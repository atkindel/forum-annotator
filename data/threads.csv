7577470,"RachelRueckert1","CommentThread","Limited Government Discussion #2 (Section 3: Last names R-Z)","You can answer 1 of the following prompts:

1) In 2015, Congress enacted legislation that gives the National Security Agency (NSA) the authority to monitor (but not listen to or read) telephone and Internet traffic, looking for patterns that might suggest terrorist activity. If the NSA detects a suspicious pattern, it presents the evidence to a secret judicial court, which decides whether the NSA’s evidence is sufficient to justify granting it a search warrant. Only if such a warrant is granted can the NSA lawfully investigate the actual content of the messages.

Do you support or oppose the NSA program? In terms of limited government, what argument could be made in support of the program? What argument could be made in opposition to it?

or

2) If your goal was to strengthen America’s system of limited government—increasing its effectiveness in controlling abuses of power—what changes would you recommend?","discussion","foundations",225,"","2015-09-01 19:17:00","2016-01-20 19:46:00","False","","","55e5f9b09714b08e1a000e1f",1,0

check and balance systems play a major role in the success of America's justice system.  Unfortunately, I believe that money is the root to all evil. High power politicians with money to spend have a lot of influence on our justice system. Our country's beliefs as said in the video, ""is routed on free choice, but it entails responsibility"".  Responsibility comes in many forms, which include taking responsibility for one's actions; it also implies ""what is good for one should be good for all"".  Changing the system is not the answer, revision of the system is. Everyone should be held accountable for their actions; it should not be based on who has the ability to pay more. I realize that the states are able to make certain laws in keeping with separation of government and the states. This is the very reason for our nation's Constitution. 
I would change the way the government enacts laws that pertain to all states, without violating the constitution of the United States.   When some states have laws that can penalize a person for a Major issue/Law, and other states this is not a law and the people of that state are free to partake in an action where in another state people are penalized, I believe this is the time the government must take action. The law should hold in all states or none. ""We are one Country, we shall not be divided.""

3234474,"jsidva","Comment","","The government would first have to be reduced in terms of physical size, overreach and the peoples' dependence on government.  The government has become a revenue center and it was never intended to be as such.  The government's power began to grow leaps and bounds by the enactment of social programs like Social Security, Medicaid, AFDC and WIC.  The dependence of the people on each of these programs strengthens the control and reach of the government.  These programs were designed to help those experiencing hardship but has now become a way of life.  One thing that should have made it into our law books are the British Poor Laws as they made a distinction between those that could not work versus those that could but chose not to.  

Another area that would help to facilitate this would be returning power back to the states.  Areas like education should not receive any funding from nor be governed by the federal government.

This would allow the federal government to get back to focusing on their core responsibilities like defense of our shores and land borders instead of who should be allowed to marry and who should not.  

Each victory that certain groups feel when they have ""won their right"" to do something just means that they require the permission of the government which is not inline with our ideal of liberty.

2064644,"DaveDWA","Comment","","mmdeford- My understanding is that in the negotiations leading to the US Constitution  a faction felt it was implied that citizens had all rights except for those that were reserved. however, James Madison insisted that a ""bill of rights"" similar to that in the Virginia Constitution be included. My thought is I like Madison in that we supposedly don't have to ""negotiate"" those rights that are in black and white- I will also say ( only half in jest) that we should have also had a ""bill of responsibilities"". 

jsidva - please  Wiki ""human rights"", it will be worth your while in that I think we will have to talk about them often. On the Supreme Court I recommend you read justice Stephn Breyer's book ""Making our democracy work"". it is a fast read and had a major impact on my thinking and understanding of how the court works. In a nutshell the Court has to work at a pace American society is willing to accept- that is why the court doesn't move fast enough to suit some people and too fast for others. 

On gay marriage, or any marriage, my personal belief is one should not have to have anyone's approval- If one's partner is of the age of consent they should be able to declare their marriage and that's the end of it----------- but that isn't how it works- thousands of years  of custom, religious and legal have made it an institution with  rules and procedures-  

My understanding is the Supreme court went beyond mere marriage and said it was a human right ( read wiki) to be able to love and be loved- that the laws against gay marriage were unconstitutional in prohibiting the basic human right to love and being loved. My belief is that this was very much in the purview of the  Court-- and society was ready for it.

Yes, mob rule is a dangerous thing. That is why we are a nation of laws  representing  the majority but protecting  the minority- at least on paper--- however, it the real world one often  has to fight like hell for what are their  rights.

8196690,"scizen","Comment","","Some measure toward term limits for Congress would be a start. We already have term limits for Presidents, so it isn't unprecedented. I'd propose a delayed enactment of term limits. No one in Congress will vote for limits if it means they will immediately be prevented from running for office again. Allow senators and house reps to hold 1 or 2 more terms respectively after the enactment of term limits. Maybe it would need to be 2 and 4 more terms, but we need to improve democracy through limiting terms. This is neutral toward all parties.

Second, there needs to be a limit on spending and taxation. Runaway spending helps nobody and harms all. Limiting government requires limiting spending. How to do it? Balanced budget legislation? Perhaps, but it needs to have teeth. How about Warren Buffett's suggestion that if Congress spent 3% over budget that they would not be allowed to run for office again?  I'd add that they would not get paid either due to failure to do their job. That would be an incentive.

>>Election to upper house of USA(Senate) is has **fixed** seat of 2 seat/state (**100** members in all).

In the light of this system, one issue that comes up is **Gerrymandering** practiced for long which is when (incumbent) political parties redraw district boundaries to give themselves an electoral advantage.

Essence of gerrymandering lies in giving opponents a small number of safe seats, while **drawing** yourself a larger number of seats for a comfortable win.
The process is so effective that in one of the state elections there was not a single seat change after the elections.

This process needs a check and balance system for **commission** to function **non-partisan**.Such function **should not be left to legislature**.","","",NA,"","2015-09-09 21:02:00","2015-09-10 05:22:00","False","","55e5f9b09714b08e1a000e1f","55f09e6301772b660d001309",2,0

Centre cannot itself impose upon states such laws that make all the states look the same(or say-united) but state should themselves consider their situation vis-a-vis other states with different laws and look appropriately what suits them. 

To address your concern-Yes, Central government should consider to propose such ideas to state, as the states should more or less have similar legislation considering nearness and trend that exists, as the neighbors in the end resemble each other with same set of problems.","","",NA,"","2015-09-09 21:45:00","2015-09-09 21:45:00","False","55ef7b499714b0505d0013cd","55e5f9b09714b08e1a000e1f","55f0a87e01772bc651001522",3,0

The American Constitution has advantages over the monarchy rooted British system that it fought against and defeated. 
But did the Constitution really reflect the values of the people, as slavery was being used to make money and Profit from
pain, brutality, murder, and moral degeneracy. The American 
economic system and its growth has its roots in slavery, and this attack upon the people of America by ""big"" business,
and corporations is still the foundation of economic and social inequality. Over 42 million people exist on food stamps.
This is not the country that the so called foundation fathers 
imagined? Or did they? As the constitution has absences of input
by African Americans, women, children, people with disabilities,
animal rights, and many political ideas of equality.

Words may form the foundations of a nation, but it's human life that makes it happen, or not happen.
Has the constitution failed in its original conception?

Power of the people is not reflected in the way that the country
is organized by the rich who own the means of production, the means of distribution and the media.

The power of the media are in the hands of the corporations
and a few rich people, and their narrow views are sold to the masses of people who lack critical skills to understand that they are being made and manufactured as units of opinions that is controlled by the power elite. The manufacture and colonialization of the human mind to believe lies and deceptions of freedoms is what makes America a much diminished democracy.

America is a very un-equal society, and one of the worst in the
developed countries of the world. Why?

Nothing is written is stone that is not changeable, and the Constitution is in a constant process of change with the demands
and power of organized opinion formers. 

It is always difficult to highlight a single thing that can improve a democracy, but the democratization of the media
is central to a well developed and informed democracy.
Vested interests and economic power is damaging the constitution and its values, therefore the way that we communicate must 
have the democratic principle imbued into the very structure
of communication, education and the way that the media is organized.

Harvard University is the greatest university in the world, and
there are many, many great American Universities, which are reflected in the vision of the Edx online free courses and education to/for the global learning community.
Hopefully the democratic principle and equality for all
will grow through and with the way that education is taken to the people of the world. Democracy does not have one geographic 
location, or one cultural group, that can claim the authority to define what democracy is, or is not.
But universities building their institutions within the internet is the 21st century form of educational democracy that is changing the way that the global community is beginning to think
and create a new future for humankind.

The solution? A free press! Get it all out there, the good, the bad, the ugly! They felt that with it all on the table and informed citizen would have a better chance  to sort it out.

Today isn't any different other than there are thousands of sources we could conceivably be trying to sort. What to do? My first response is to be skeptical ( not necessarily cynical)of everything. Let's face it, even the most honest, even handed has a bias. 

How I think about ""the News"" and what I am trying to get from it is first, ""what is the fact""? For example, ""7,000 Syrian refugees crossed the Hungarian boarder""- that is a fact------ but the real question is ""what does this mean? What are the biases I'm going to hear, what  are the various ""spins""? ""How knowledgeable am I of the history leading to this fact?"" ""What are the many ways it could play out""? etc. 

For me I detest Fox news, Rush Limbaugh and that ilk. The sources I rely on ( with skepticism) are PBS,NPR, NYT, WP,BBC, AP, Etc- a zinger is I also read the WSJ- I think their reports are good and their op-eds suck-- however, many of the letters to the editor, explaining  why the WSJ editorial is off-base are well written and very informative. Well, reading the ""lame stream media"" labels me a ""liberal"" in some quarters. Funny thing is, I always saw myself as center right and voted that way from tricky Dick through 2 terms of Dubya.  But I left when Palin was the choice to be one heart beat away from the presidency. 

Anyway, I think one can get balanced and nuanced  news reports--- but if you are a ""Bubba"" who views affairs as black or white, Coke vs. Pepsi, Lib vs, con there is plenty of media to stoke that fire.

There needs to be some type of control like a group that looks for and investigates abuses of power.  This group cannot be tied to any political party and should represent citizens, not the government.   Additionally, elected officials need to be limited in their powers when it comes to special interest groups or those that contribute money to that elected official.  If each official had to publicly reveal how much and from whom they receive money from then it could help keep them honest in their positions.

Congressional and Judicial Term Limits:
 
PRO: It would more easily allow new blood and new ideas to enter the marketplace of ideas. Lifetime appointments to The Federal Bench are a legacy-builder for a President long out of office. Justice Douglas served for 36 years (FDR through Ford). Congressman Dingell served 59 years in the House. (Eisenhower to Obama).  It can be argued that public service should follow the tradition of GWashington: Serve a limited time, then go home. 

CON: Congressional Term Limits are not needed... the will of the voter is needed to oust those who have gotten too comfortable in their public service. (Tho, the voter - seeing that the entire system is run under a seniority system - has a vested interest in making sure their guy is in there a nice long time... that way, the swag gets shipped home in boxcars #SenatorByrd).
Judicial term limits might work, if there is a way to de-politicize the process.  A lifetime appointment allows for jurists to follow their interpretation of the law, not fealty to the President/Party that gave them their Robe.

To uphold such rights , an independent judiciary, one not under the thumb of the regime, is a necessity.

Minority views are important. Probably every view now widely held was once a minority view.Most of what is now public policy became law as a result of conflict between majority and minority groups. Furthermore, just as it is true that a minority view may grow over time until it is widely accepted, so may a majority view eventually prove unwise, unworkable , or unwanted.

Shefali-Sharma My response to your points;

you say 'relatively"" amateur- some are rank amateur at my state level never having held any elective office. They get elected because the general turnout for the election is low and their supporter turnout is high.

you say 'the provision is not only to give others opportunity..."" The fact is everyone already  has opportunity. you don't have to ""kick out"" the experienced office holder to give opportunity. - I could run in my district if I wanted to. You are concerned about one person or family having power for too long- that is a real concern that I share-but- I look to a free press, the checks and balances of our governance and the competing interests of the voter to put a muzzle on it. I hope you are familiar with the phrase "" don't throw the baby out with the bathwater""- if not what it means is don't throw something valuable ( the baby, experience) out with something that needs to go ( the bathwater, potential corruption, cronyism).

you say ""the short-term political power gives them ability ..."" let me repeat- many of these new comers know absolutely nothing about governance. They are babes in the woods, they couldn't find their ass with both hands. This isn't theoretical on my part, term limits are the law in my state government and every informed observer from every political persuasion says term limits are a failure and have failed to deliver on what they promised. What did they promise? The benefits you argue in your post. 

You say ""long term political power in hands of the same person..."" You are repeating yourself and yes, I agree. I will repeat myself and say the guard is a free press, checks and balances and competing voter interests.  By ""voter interests"" I mean for example the current ""big spending lib socialist congressman"" has been in office 20 years. opposition  to his way of doing business arises though a grass roots tea party and the outcome may be more voters like ""big spending' and he stays in power or more voters like tax cuts and he is voted out- an overly  simplistic explanation but this is what I mean by competing voter interests.

We see school district consolidation- they all promise lower cost and better service---- sometimes they deliver on the promise.

However, in the spirit of friendly debate I will take the opposite side of this argument. please consider these points;

I live in a rural farming district, some of my needs and outlook are different than a city dweller and I want a congressman who is what I am and will represent and stand up for  what is important to me. If my district is lumped with the city which has different needs and 10 times more voters the reality will be that I have very little representation.

When the founding fathers set up 2 houses, the senate and House, senators had 6 year terms and were appointed by their state assemblies while the house had 2 year terms with the only direct voter election. the reason was to make them close and accountable to the voter. This is the closest we can get to our federal reps- and there are benefits to closeness, the biggest is the chance to have your voice herd. 

 I'll go on a tangent here and ask if you go to your city council meetings (if you are a city dweller) or in my case the monthly township meeting? I go to some of my township meetings ( I don't go regularly- shame on me) and this is as close as you can get to your reps. The refreshing thing about governance at this level is you are with you neighbors, many of them you know at least well enough to nod to if you pass on the street.

Consideration of electoral systems is important in regard to this question. Two major parties and a first-past-the-post voting system means that there are likely issues and views important to citizens that are not brought before Congress. Electoral reform may be something to look into.

I think I would limit corporate interests in government - there are a few people who are not elected but merely rich that have a lot of power to influence important decisions, to their own advantage and not the greater good of the public. They use money and manipulation to control the government, through vast donations and super-PACs - that is *not* what a democracy should look like.

8196690,"scizen","Comment","","The dictum and rally cry that launched America was ""no taxation without representation."" This reflects the principle of representative democracy or that just government comes from the consent of the governed (the demos, the people).
A corollary that merits exploration is ""no representation without taxation."" This should not be taken to mean that those who pay no tax should have no representation, but rather than to grant consent and obtain representation, all need to be taxed in an unbiased manner.
Why would this strengthen the principle of limited government? Because it would prevent the growing untaxed people from demanding and getting more benefits from a government that must borrow the money to give them the benefits. This is no small matter with 2015 racking up close to  $1T deficit. These debts will eventually bankrupt us and then the concept of limited government will be gone forever.

Taking a trip down memory lane there was a time when there were only 3 television networks and in print the dailies like the NYT and WP and weeklies like Time and Newsweek lead the general information field.

Today, there are thousands of sources vying to break a story and for better or worse there is nothing that can be hidden for long.  

I agree TV ""news"" is a lowest common  Bubba denominator affair but it's about ratings and crap sells. However, the information is out there if you want it in specialty magazines like ""Foreign Policy"" and more that only wonks have heard of.

6643685,"HarryOne","Comment","","Two points before I address the question:

First, the question understates the importance of the legislation referenced, the USA Freedom Act. In short, this legislation walked back a number of practices by the NSA and other federal agencies like the Justice Department under Section 215 of the Patriot Act and was a step in the direction of greater citizen privacy and government transparency.  Under the USA Freedom Act, the NSA will no longer be able to engage in indiscriminate or bulk collection of phone record and internet traffic of American citizens and will only be able to query these data—held by telecommunications and internet service providers—on a case-by-case basis on the approval of the secret (FISA) court. This is the summary from the Center for Democracy and Technology that places the current law in better perspective (https://cdt.org/press/victory-passage-of-usa-freedom-act-reins-in-nsa-surveillance/) 

“…..the bill will end nationwide bulk collection of records about Americans under Section 215 and other provisions of the PATRIOT Act. The bill will also enact important transparency laws – including more government reporting requirements on the extent of surveillance, new permissions for companies to report the number of surveillance orders they receive, and a requirement that the government declassify significant FISA Court opinions (or release detailed summaries of the opinions).”
Details about what the USA Freedom Act requires can be found here https://cdt.org/insight/comparison-of-2014-and-2015-versions-of-the-usa-freedom-act/ 

Second, let there be no doubt that the examination of ‘metadata’—who called whom, when or who emailed whom when—can reveal a great deal of information about individuals, even without looking at the content. If Person A calls their oncologist, their spouse, then other members of their family, and finally their pastor, one can conclude with a high probability of accuracy that Person A is struggling with a dire situation or that s/he has just heard a reprieve. We should not kid ourselves: our metadata tells quite a bit about us. 

To the question: I support the NSA program as it will be restricted once the USA Freedom Act is fully implemented. The world has become a much more dangerous place, and phone or email metadata may well be useful in identifying a threat to our common security. The new law both recognizes this possible national security interest while at the same time striking a better balance with individual privacy. 

A better balance has been needed for a variety of reasons. The Fourth Amendment protects American citizens in the “persons, houses, papers and effects”. In a world where it is impossible to live a full adult life without communicating digitally, surely our digital footprints have some Fourth Amendment protection.  Additionally, the very knowledge that the government has access to all of one’s communications has a chilling effect on expression and consequently also raises question of reckless infringement on the First Amendment freedom of expression. For sure, when national security is involved these protections have to be balanced against the national security need. But the choice between unrestricted bulk collection of metadata, on the one hand, and security on the other, has been a false one. And there’s the kicker. 

The reason I support a balance that restricts and slows down access to citizen metadata to achieve a better balance for privacy has to do with questions about the efficacy of the NSA program itself. The Presidential Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board is comprised of people nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The appointees to this Board were from the intelligence community and their findings were vetted with that community. On examining the NSA bulk collection program, it found not ONE instance, over the many years this program was in effect, where the analysis of bulk data by the NSA produced information related to a terrorist plot.

The government spying on your privacy won't be aproblem unless you're a criminal trying to harm others. After all, it is the governments job to make sure that everyone is safe and this is them taking the next step. In opposition the government no longer can control, the use or development of sophisticated surveillance and suppresive technologies, so it's imperative to develop philosophies and policies suitable to the protection of privacy and other interests in private sector contexts.

We will need a very sharp analysis of its legality and balance of the rights endangered before deciding about them. This specific case is a very good example of an action that, when undertaken, can threaten individual rights in benefit of National security, which is also our individual and collective security. But if refused, our individual rights may be preserved, but then National security, that is also our individual and collective security, can be weakened.

1485804,"Digby11","Comment","","I oppose the NSA monitoring program, mainly because it lacks necessary oversight & accountability.

From a limited government standpoint the program can be defended by noting that 'safeguards' exist within it, including an independent storage of information, and the inclusion of court oversight of requests for reviews of this information. In this regard government is restricted in its ability to unilaterally use this information.

An argument in opposition would note that while the content of the information is kept separate from government, and requires a warrant for access, the actual mechanics of network identification--relating who is 'talking' with whom--provides significant information about an individual to which government has no apparent right--a direct intrusion on individual liberty. There is no oversight or control over the extent of such network identification, suggesting it will involve those innocent as well as those not innocent, with the innocent potentially suffering repercussions (e.g., inclusion on the 'no fly' list). This aspect of the system is secret and lacks sufficient accountability, and therefore poses a danger to limited government.","","",NA,"","2015-09-13 15:28:00","2015-09-13 15:28:00","False","","55e5f9b09714b08e1a000e1f","55f5961701772b38df001684",2,0

I would neither weaken nor strengthen the existing powers of the various branches of government but would seek to diminish the influence of external forces on government and increase the influence and engagement of it's citizens. 

 - Campaigns should be publicly funded to reduce or remove the influence that money has on elections. 
 - Limits on the activity of lobbyists and special interest groups in their interactions with congressmen and their staffs should be enacted to allow for no more than simply and transparently providing research and opinions to congressional committees or members about their interests. The strong bonds between special interests and the legislators must be weakened to a level that is secondary to the public interest in government. 
 - The revolving door between corporate consultants/board rooms and government positions must be mediated or curtailed if not forbidden altogether. 
 - Differed or non-prosecution agreements between institutions or corporations and governmental regulatory agencies must be publicly disclosed, judicially vetted and enforced in all cases. 
 - Laws should make voting easier for citizens and electronic voting should be fully implemented and encouraged.
 - Some type of compulsory service to the country should be enacted for all majority citizens.

These are changes that would ultimately strengthen government against corruption and abuse of power and provide more equal access for citizens to the bodies that govern them.","","",NA,"","2015-09-13 17:20:00","2015-09-13 17:20:00","False","","55e5f9b09714b08e1a000e1f","55f5b05b9714b008a300171d",2,0

2862179,"JuanYlarri","Comment","","To answer the question abouy the NSA program, I think it could be convenient to quote a german author, Robert Alexy. When there are a conflict between two constitutional rights, the problem can be solve with balancing. the author said  that balancing is one part of what is required by a more comprehensive principle. This more comprehensive principle is the principle of proportionality. The principle of proportionality consists of three sub-principles: the principles of suitability, of necessity, and of proportionality in the narrow sense.
The principle of suitability excludes the adoption of means obstructing the realisation of at least one principle without promoting any principle or goal for which they were adopted.
This principle of necessity requires that of two means promoting one principle that are, equally suitable, the one that interferes less intensively in other principle ought to be chosen.
The principle of proportionallity in narrow sense is balancing. Alexy says that the Law of Balancing shows that balancing can be broken down into three stages. The first stage is a matter of establishing the degree of nonsatisfaction of, or detriment to, the first principle. This is followed by a second stage, in which the importance of satisfying the competing principle is established. Finally, the third stage answers the question of whether or not the importance of satisfying the competing principle justifies the detriment to, or non-satisfaction of, the first.
We can say that the NSA program is suitable for the goal that seeks. But it's not necessary, because it's not the one that interferes less intensely. Indeed, maybe there are others means to look for terrorist activity, without violating the right for privacy.
The bill of rights it's a very important part of a limited government. But all the branches must have their entire faculty to fulfill American interest.
On the other hand to strengthen America’s system of limited government, it is important to have a free press, and let a real discussion in the society about public matters.

2064644,"DaveDWA","Comment","","garyomer- The following is from wiki on thalidomide; ""
The U.S. FDA refused to approve thalidomide for marketing and distribution. However, the drug was distributed in large quantities for testing purposes, after the American distributor and manufacturer Richardson-Merrell had applied for its approval in September 1960. The official in charge of the FDA, Frances Oldham Kelsey, did not rely on information from the company, which did not include any test results. Richardson-Merrell was called on to perform tests and report the results. The company refused and demanded approval six times, and was refused each time. Nevertheless, a total of 17 children with thalidomide-induced malformations were born in the U.S.""

But for the sake of argument, what would we say if the FDA had approved the drug? Would we say the FDA was of no use or would we say a tragic mistake was made calling for investigation and correction? As you may know, the FDA is often accused on moving too slowly on new unproven ""miracle"" drugs. I suspect that over time and on some drugs we will find that is true. However, I don't believe discovering unintended side effects is an exact science, rather I think it depends on trial use and study- even then there will always be a chance of unintended consequences. 

And as the wiki quote suggests, had there been no FDA the drug companies would have brought thalidomide to the market.

I don´t agree with this part. Especially Areas like education, which determine the future of the whole country, should be funded by the federal government. I really disagree with the system schools receive their money. It also depends on the taxes payed by the residents of the district(at least in Oregon).

A Parliamentary system provides more immediate power to the majority, which, of course, can viewed as both good (respond more quickly to exigencies of the day) or bad (tyranny triumphs, minority interests ignored or rode roughshod over).

This solved the problem of the overpowering senate before, giving every state, no matter what the population, equal representation in the Senate. Then the Electoral College was designed and made it so that the candidate, running for president, with the most of the electoral votes would win presidency. The Electoral college made it so the ratio of electors was matched to that of the members of the Congress (House and Senate put together).

Presidential elections cause increased voting, but there is also a coattail effect. Elections become nationalized due to the presidential race. It would be far more likely that one party takes control of the government until the next election (although realistically speaking this is a tad improbable, unless it is the Republicans, due to gerrymandering and REDMAP). It also removes an element of checks and balances. Midterm elections typically work against the President and his party. This allows the opposing party to come in and exert more control. It serves as a check on the other party. It also serves as a referendum on the President as his policies are indirectly on the ballot that election. The staggered elections are better for the people and the parties.","","",NA,"","2015-09-15 18:58:00","2015-09-15 18:58:00","False","","55e5fa8d9714b0069b000e5a","55f86a4d9714b0505d001929",2,0
7930424,"Tfkalk","Comment","","As Shawn mentioned, part of the problem is the disproportionate amount of attention that races receive. However, this is not the total problem as local and state elections get a large amount of coverage from local newspapers and press which are one of the top sources of news for Americans. One of the main problems is that there are many elections. Due to primaries, we effectively vote for each office twice. We vote for who we want to be our respective party's nominee and then vote for who will hold the office. In addition, every year has an election. There are the presidential years that oftentimes have Senate, state, and local offices at stake. In presidential years and the midterm years, we have House elections and probably state and/or local elections. But wait, there's more! In the odd years, there are many local races at play.

One of the other major problems is the amount of time at hand. Even though it is one of the most important civic duties, we give a very low amount of time to vote. Many states have one day and only a few hours at that. Also, that one day is a Tuesday, a day when most Americans are working.

The low amount of time negatively affects working Americans, especially working parents. If a person has to dash home for work and take care of their children, voting is not very high on the priority list, especially since many voting precincts have lines and nobody wants to wait in line with their child. A majority of the voting hours coincide with the working hours. Parents, especially single parents, are among the most disadvantaged.

The voting laws also cause disenfranchisement. Voter ID laws negatively impact the elderly and the poor. Statistics also show a negative impact on minorities. A voter ID law was passed in Pennsylvania, with the state government pointing out that voters could go to a Department of Transportation office to get an ID if they did not have one. Problem is that not every county had a PennDOT office. Now people had to drive an hour of more just to wait in line for a long period of time. Eventually, Pennsylvania's law was overturned in part due to the accessibility problems.","","",NA,"","2015-09-15 19:10:00","2015-09-15 19:10:00","False","","55e5fb8701772be57d000de0","55f86d279714b083ce0018ea",2,0

In the USA, the legislature and the executive do not have to be aligned and often work against each other. policy implementation can be much slower and more moderated. therefore, there is frequently not just one party in power at a time and the executive should not be fully blamed for the outcome of their time in office because many of their preferred policies were never actually implemented. in fact, in the USA variant of the presidential system, a legislature held by a different party, even if only one chamber, has political incentives to effectively sabotage the outcome of the other side, even almost blatantly, because when power is fragmented, the executive will be held accountable for any  perceived failures, even when the opposition significantly contributed to them.

in the USA, in all but one state, voters must go through a separate registration process before voting, and the vast majority of states do not allow election day registration. this two step process register, then vote is more complication then the process in many other countries and discourages some Americans from voting. in majority of the European country voter lists are generated from large population databases or by other government agencies. for example, Germans who are eighteen or older on voting day automatically receive a notification card before any election in which they are eligible to vote. 
By eliminating American's two step process of first registering and then voting, voter turnout would increase. the voting process can be further simplified by generating voter lists based on such preexisting government information as driver's licenses, income tax returns, and juror registration information. until America eliminates this two step process, allowing for election day registration would help increase voter turnout.

8181298,"jamesett","Comment","","I believe one factor that has a significant impact on the voter turnout in the United States in comparison to that of Europe, beyond our voter registration laws, is the limitations of two party dominated system. In many European countries coalitions between multiple parties are needed to get the voter percentage which constitutes their mandate to govern. This allows for greater nuance in party platforms which in turn creates a sense among voters that their vote is for a party for which their values align. In addition, even if their party does not win the largest percentage of votes, the need for their party's inclusion in the coalition means that their perspective needs to be taken into account.

By contrast, in the United State, the binary political system alienates many voters who feel as though neither option fully represents their viewpoint and thus decide not to participate. I have heard from countless young people about how they view both parties to contribute to the partisan bickering and thus describe themselves as apolitical.

This has in turn provided added power to voters as compared with the previous system and they have acquired a more direct voice in the election process.
With the more recent system of separate elections for House members, senators, and the president voters have greater influence over lawmakers as they choose members of the legislative branch and often enough they elect those who are believed by the public to identify with the respective voter's needs, this in turn allows for members of the legislature to act as advocates of those who elected them, and has an impact on their decision-making and the process of lawmaking.
A parliamentary system in turn provided the voters with a restricted amount of power over the legislature and lesser influence over government decisions.

Voting rates are lower in the United States because the percentage of eligible voters who are registered voters is not as great as in Europe, U.S. has about 75% of eligible voters registered to vote, whereas Europe has over 90% of eligible voters registered.
Voter registration is a burden that individuals in the U.S. must carry as they need to make sure they are registered, hence it is their responsibility to decide if their voice can be heard. In contrast, in Europe the registration is done automatically by the government.
In addition, several constraints exist when it comes to acquiring a voter ID in America, as lower income and lesser education groups may not have the knowledge or the resources to acquire this ID, needed to essentially exercise their right to vote.

8086935,"MurrayHunter","Comment","","The original system for electing federal officials placed the charge with state legislators to appoint senators and to elect the president. Those eligible to become state legislators were for the most part white males with property and wealth. The house of representatives was the sole branch of government in which the people could elect representatives, again where eligible voters were essentially white males of property. The system today provides for the election of the members of the house of representatives and  the senate through the popular vote of a majority of the people in the respective states . The president is elected by the people through the electoral college , which is effectively based on the simple majority in each state with each state having assigned votes based on their population. This can mean that it is possible for the president to be elected with the most electoral college votes but not necessarily the highest popular vote. This occurred for example in the 2000 presidential election where George Bush received a lower popular vote than Al Gore but had more electoral college votes. 

Eligibility for voting has also changed over the years with the elimination of state literacy tests and poll taxes that discriminated against the poor and African Americans. To a lesser extent there is still a bias against these groups in states that require eligible voters to provide government IDs that have a cost associated with them and act as a deterrent to those who either can't afford to get or where it is inconvenient to get the required ID.

Voting participation is generally lower in the US national elections compared to other democratic countries primarily because of eligibility requirements and the onus on the individuals to register to vote compared to countries like Canada where individual voting roles are developed by census takers.  US elections have mandated dates for elections to elect a president every 4 years, senators every six years and representatives every two years. Other parliamentary democracies like Canada, the UK and Australia have a system where election dates vary depending on whether the government has a majority ( can be called anytime within a 5 year period ) in the ruling party or whether a minority government is defeated in a motion of non-confidence by a majority of the House of Commons. Senators and members of The House of Lords are appointed in Canada and the UK, not elected. These systems allow for uncertainty in terms of when elections are called and can allow the ruling governments to pick an election date at their choosing , if they have a majority that can work in their favour or have the reverse where elections can occur more frequently in a minority government where they are defeated in a non-confidence motion. There are pros and cons to each system. In the US system there is certainty on election dates and so legislation can be carried out during the mandated period. A parliamentary system typically allows for more political parties ( 3 main parties in Canada ) where it is more difficult to get consensus with a minority government , however , usually with more compromise in legislation. The opposite is true with a majority government where legislation is passed more readily with less ability for compromise. The US system with its checks and balances in the legislative branches of government is a more cumbersome and drawn out before legislation is passed. Both systems unfortunately cater to the public , trying to enact legislation to please everyone with an eye to getting re-elected.","","",NA,"","2015-09-15 22:28:00","2015-09-15 22:28:00","False","","55e5fa6201772bc852000dac","55f89b9401772b5ea60018b0",2,0

The Presidential election, for example, is decided by state by state electoral vote. When a candidate wins a state’s popular vote, they win the electoral votes as well. We also stagger term limits for the Senate, (six years,) and the House, (two years.) This is to help reduce the risk of one party controlling all parts of the system.
Since the UK holds all elections at the same time, it is completely plausible for one political party to control all, and since the term limits are all the same, it allows that party to remain in control until the next election. This paves the way for corruption and hinders the ability of the minority to have a voice.
I feel Americans have the better system, because of the staggered term limits. Since our election cycle is set up this way, it’s fairly uncommon for total control at any one time. However, I think an added limit of the amount of times one can serve would be helpful to keep congress fresh and less inundated with lobbyists. If the members of Congress change more often, lobbyists will have a harder time greasing the palms of leadership.

While it could result in a split governance (as we saw with the Republican Revolutions of 1996, 2010 and 2014), it would more probably be a situation where house cleaning would occur... dissatisfaction with the actions in the immediate past could lead to a dramatic upheaval in leadership and national direction.

1485804,"Digby11","Comment","","The original system for electing federal officials restricted democratic choice to members of the House of representatives--these would be selected directly by the people. Senators were appointed by state legislatures, making them one step removed from popular choice. And presidents were selected by electors, appointed by state legislatures, making presidents twice removed from the people. Over time, however, the choice of senators has been transferred to the people, and they now exercise considerable influence over the election of president through the practice of tying presidential electoral votes to popular vote outcomes. Democracy, therefore, is considerably more evident in the present system than in the original system.

As for influence, however, the people still are limited in the direct expression of their interests into the process of governance. While the people have considerable influence over the House, the staggering of terms in the Senate, where only one-third of the members are up for election at any one time, mitigates the influence of contemporary voters through the legacy presence of prior voting 'publics.' Also, with all elected members serving fixed terms, the public can only interject its interest at prescribed points in the political process, regardless of how well aligned is the political process to their current interests.

In contrast to this voters in parliamentary systems have more direct influence, as they selected a ruling majority (outright or coalitional) at the time of an election, and can influence the longevity of the ruling majority through the maintenance or withdrawal of support for its legislative agenda. While this allows voters to have more direct say in the process of governance it can, as in the case of Italy, lead to instability in governance, which the U.S. system is not as prone to.","","",NA,"","2015-09-15 23:15:00","2015-09-15 23:15:00","False","","55e5fab49714b0b433000de8","55f8a6ab9714b06f3d00190d",2,0

All the foregoing structural elements of the electoral college system of 1787 remain in effect currently. The original method of electing the President and vicepresident, however, proved unworkable, and was replaced by the 12th Amendment, ratified, in 1804 Under the original system, each elector cast two votes for President (for different candidates ) and no vote for Vicepresident. The candidate provide it was a majority of the number of elector, was elected President and the runner-up become Vicepresiedent. The 12th Amendment replaced this system with separate ballots for President and Vicepresident, with electors casting a simply vote for each office. A parlamentary system is designed to put one party into legislative and executive control and give that party the tool to both enact and implement its program. In the American-style system, with a bicameral congress an independently elected president who can veto bills which he disagrees, that's why at the present no party has the votes to pass it's bills without the compromiso cooperation of the other party. Considering this, I believe parlamentarian system has partisan cooperation and compromise providing voters greater influence over lawmakers.

We have a supreme law in the Constitution, but it can be and has been changed to help adapt our government to the changing needs of our nation. At the founding generation, there was little direct election at the federal level beyond election to the House of Representatives. The voting franchise was also severely limited to landowning free males. The next generation extended it to all men, then the next freed an entire race, the next recognized that we could no longer disenfranchise our women, the next fought tyranny abroad and marched for voting rights at home. If ""Every generation decides for itself the fate of liberty,"" so, too, does every generation decide what freedom means in their time. 

If you compare our federal system of elections with that of the UK, the US has several distinct advantages over it's long time ally. First, UK is a unitary government: they do not have states with whom they share power, unlike the US where power is divided between the federal government and the powerful state governments. While this simplifies voting in the national legislature, it also limits voters as to their influence in policy making.

The first is that most of the major elected offices in the federal government are directly chosen by popular vote rather than by state officials, and the second is that the set of people eligible to vote has expanded radically.

The original franchise made sense; granting votes to property-owning males was a simple way of ensuring that only responsible adults would be allowed to vote. However, as education and technology improved and institutional slavery was abolished, it likewise made sense to expand the franchise, allowing many more of the people to exert influence now than at the inception of the republic.

The staggered elections implemented by the Constitution prevent sudden shifts in the balance of power. However, their public acceptability is questionable. It seems that someone is always campaigning for office here, and the low voter turnout may simply be the product of political fatigue.

The US, meanwhile, in keeping with it's focus on individuality, makes the voter responsible to register to vote, and even leaves it up to the voter whether they wish to vote at all. Hence, one of the contributing factors to lower voter turnout in the US versus Europe is because voting is an individual choice. 

But some individuals are more inclined to vote than others. Studies show that those in the higher income brackets, those who are highly educated and have more of a stake in the economy, are more likely to vote. Their voices are more likely to be heard and their views form the status quo. So, any group that can potentially disrupt this influence has to be discouraged from voting. If it is known that low income Americans and minorities vote for candidates and issues that harm those among the well to do, then those with the current control of the national debate feel as if they must do something to protect the status quo. 

Low income Americans, minorities, felons, and those on the fringes of society face rules to voting that others never have to. Most voters have state ID cards. Most have a basic understanding of civics. Most have not committed a violent felony and had their voting rights taken away. So, because life experiences are different, the misunderstandings of life circumstances create a gulf a mile wide. 

Gerrymandering also allows a segregation of a sort, in that some districts are more suburban and well to do, while a district next door could be a majority-minority district.

Even though the 14th and 15th amendment guaranteed equal rights to African Americans,some states,especially in the South made it impossible for them to register with literacy tests and poll taxing,which was eventually banned with the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the 24th amendment.","","",NA,"","2015-09-16 02:35:00","2015-09-16 02:35:00","False","","55e5fb8701772be57d000de0","55f8d58e9714b0044d0019df",2,0

Belgium, Turkey, Australia, Greece, Luxembourg and some elections in France have these mandatory voting laws, so it's not really surprising voter turnout is higher in these places.

Also, Greg Palast's articles last year, 'Jim Crow Returns' and a follow-up about the Interstate Crosscheck, go along way to explaining why US elections currently have a lower turnout, with voter registration becoming increasingly difficult.

The relative merits of the British form of government make it especially compatible to rich and poor nations alike. The elasticity of its unwritten constitutional forms proved ideal for Asian Countries like Pakistan and India. "" In the United States powers of Federal Government and Congress are strictly limited to certain matters ; in other matters the individual states and their legislatures are sovereign within their own boundaries. This constitution has manifested some weaknesses, comparatively unimportant, though it has served the United States well since its adoption in 1788 and is the most outstanding example of a successful written Constitution in modern times "" .It would be wrong to assume that the American Constitution has been completely ignored. In fact, emerging countries have tried their best to incorporate the best aspects from both British and American Constitutions. For example, Australia established a Federal Government closely resembling in many respects the aspects of the Constitution of the United States of America but incorporating the traditional British principle of an executive responsible to Parliament.This is the case with many Afro-Asian countries also. Another responsible factor , as H.G.Wells pointed out , is that for a century, the American tradition, especially after the Monroe Doctrine, was to disregard the Old World. Circumstances conspired to make it a world representative but it deftly thwarted destiny to lead a sequestered existence till the Second World War.

In America it is the responsibility of the Individual to register for the vote while the course material indicates that registration of voters is more or less automatic in Europe.  It seems to me to some extent that America may have a better system because of ""individualism"".  In the UK (Britain) for example a voter does not really vote for an individual candidate as I understand the system but votes for a Party slate of Candidates.  If Party A gets 45% of the votes and Party B gets 40% of the votes and Party C gets 15% of the votes (nationwide) then apparently all parties will get some representation in Commons even though, perhaps, Party C was never a majority in any ""constituency"" or district.  So while an American might be voting for an individual candidate (particularly in off year elections) in addition to party preferences... well, then you have the situation in the UK where, perhaps some minority party interest is encouraged because some of ""your people"" might get a voice in Parliament even though none of them actually would have won a seat in an American Style election.  Of course two parties as we have in America (and there is some research to indicate that a stable equilibrium in our political system is 2 major political parties might generate less interest than a system with more parties and then, theoretically, more choices of issues as opposed to individuals.  

The course material shows that the poor are most likely to be hurt by US Election Laws but I have not attempted to search for comparisons with Europe.  Surely in Europe the poor are more likely to be disenfranchised by their system as well, although, perhaps not to so great an extent.  Of course, if more individuals are serviced by a welfare system (in Europe) there might be reasons to vote so as to keep welfare benefits high.  Invidiuals might feel voting is in their interest wheras in the United States where the poor are expected to make it on their own (and neither party really cares all that much about ""the poor"") then lower income individuals might feel that America is basically a country with ""welfare for the Rich"" and their vote does not matter anyway even if they did register.

The citizens of the United States have gained more power, I believe, than they started out with at the end of the Revolutionary War. They vote with great frequency and vote into office both those with legislative and with executive power. There have also been strides in voter eligibility - no American has to taken a literary test any more, but there have been some backwards steps as well with the prevalence of gerrymandering meaning that few Congressional seats are really contested at all.


In Canada, we vote at three different levels - for the municipal government, the provincial legislature and the federal representatives.

 Federally, there is one general election that must be held every five years (this is a new rule) but can be called at anytime with the Prime Minister going to the Governor General (the Queen's Representative and the executive power) and requesting an election be called. Federal election campaigns typically take place over five weeks, not like the two year campaigns that the United States has for presidential elections (though this year, the campaign is eleven weeks long, and the vote will be held on the 19th of October). On the day of the general election, each eligible voter goes to the polls and picks one person on the ballot that they think would make a good representative in the House of Commons (our House of Representatives). There are currently three major political parties in Canada - the Conservatives, the Liberals and the New Democrats, with a couple of smaller parties like the Green Party and the Quebec separatist Bloc Quebecois as well - all of these (excluding the Bloc, who only elects representatives in Quebec) will have candidates across the country. We vote in a first past the post system, so the person with the most votes wins in your riding (electoral district) and will sit in the House of Commons as your riding's representative. The party has more members elected to the House of Commons (we call them MPs - members of Pariament) will form the government and the party leader will become the Prime Minister. The party with the second most seats leads the Official Opposition.

 We still have the archaic system of an *appointed* Senate. It is a terribly dysfunctional system. The Prime Minister goes to the Governor General every time a senator retires (at 75 or earlier) and recommended another person to sit in the Upper House. We have no say in the appointment of Senators and the past few years the Upper House has been mired with political scandals and lots of people calling for reform or abolishment (this requires the consent of the provinces). 

Voters in the US have much more say in the lawmaking process. In Canada, if an Opposition MP introduces a bill in a majority government, it will hardly ever pass through the House let alone the Senate.

If the general public is armed, any unjust action against any given person or group will be resisted, with force when necessary. As there is a guaranty of an uprising if the people feel abused, the government, which desires to remain in power, will find it in its own interest to bow to the wishes of the people. And if any group of the people fell abused by another group, they can and will protect themselves form their oppressors, again, with force if necessary. As the oppressors would generally prefer to stay alive, and leave the targeted oppressed alone, than die attacking the intended oppressed, (terrorists are notorious exceptions) they will let alone the people they would otherwise oppress.

There have been three excellent, separate examples of this principle played out in history, two of which happened in the U.S., which I will discuss.
The first example I will discuss is also the first chronologically. During the middle ages, the people of England were to obey a law which many people living today would find very strange. Every boy, when he reached the age of seven, was to be given a bow and five arrows, and was to be taught how to use them. The purpose of this law was to protect against invasion. It was very successful in that regard. England has not been successfully invaded since the eleventh century, a record for European nations. It has also had the effect of giving the common man rights, at a time when such things were nearly unheard of in other nations. This demonstrates the uses of general armament between nations.

The second example should be very familiar to most of the students here, the American revolution. It is self evident, that in order to win a war against a strong military power in the possession of large armies armed with guns, cannons and a large fleet, that those opposed to said military power must have weapons of their own. This was quite clearly the case in the  American revolution, as many of the men who fought against the British used their own muskets. (the cannons were stolen from the British) These personally owned weapons, in combination with the military tactics borrowed from the native americans, such as not making yourself a target out in plain sight when you can hide behind something, were major factors in the final outcome in the war. This is an example of people defending themselves from an oppressive government.

The third example is not so prominent, though it deserves to be. During and preceding the civil rights movement, as students of american history know, there were many instances when a black person did something, or was accused of doing something illegal for him to do, that white people, especially the KKK, would go to that persons home, and lynch him. What is not so commonly known, is that during that time, many black people decided to obtain a gun for self protection. Some would go hungry rather than be without ammunition. It is not known how many attempted lynchings were interrupted by bullets shot in self defense, but as more and more black people obtained guns, lynching started to look less and less appealing. And today, there have not been any lynchings in the U.S. for decades. This shows how self defense can force oppression to end.

To conclude, general self defense will prevent and reverse oppression at every level no matter the oppressor, so long as the oppressed are armed.

7739224,"Bhoward2","Comment","","I prematurely submitted an incomplete response and so now will finish.
I am a U.S. citizen who has never experienced life under a parliamentary system, and I must admit that such a system appeals to me.  Parliamentary systems generally offer greater ease of legislating, the potential for more diversity in the legislature, more evenly spread power, more meaningful debates, less gridlock, and in some cases, flexible elections.  By contrast, I can find almost no positive thing to say about the presidential system as it currently operates in this country.

Because the head of government is not directly elected in a parliamentary system, a substantial barrier to those seeking office exists because one must first attain a seat in parliament to be eligible.  This seems less democratic than a presidential system but may be countered by the potential for every election to change the chief executive.  I think that this alone gives the people a much more powerful voice in the process.

However, parliaments that are unicameral give rise to some concerns.  The potential for unchecked legislative power, unstable coalitions and elections abuse may affect the success of the process and its policies and thus hamper the ability of the people to be heard.  

Parliamentary cabinet posts are inhabited by elected officials while presidential cabinet members are appointed.  The parliamentary system's methodology no doubt reduces the possibility of cronyism which pervades so many governments.  This would suggest a more robust response to the voice of the people.

The parliamentary system essentially provides to the ruling government a mandate to govern according to its will and thus legislators can be held accountable for their policies.  Contrast this with presidential system legislation often written and passed by individuals of different parties; it is not always clear who is to blame (or thank).

While the strategy behind the idea of staggering U.S. elections is sound, I fear that the reality tells a somewhat different tale, particularly in the case of the House of Representatives.  House members relatively short two year terms result in the compulsion to begin raising money for reelection as soon as they take office.  Another unintended consequence is that the evolution of the election process in the U.S. has resulted in a quite substantial extension of the pre-election season, a pitfall neatly avoided by the parliamentary system.  

I confess I had little understanding of the parliamentary system before this question was encountered, and so I have included my research sources.  I do feel like the parliamentary system is preferable in almost every way, but again, I have never had to live under it.  It just seems to follow the parliamentary system is structured in such a way that its leaders have no choice but to respond to the electorate, a feature which feels sorely lacking in our particular presidential system.

8174584,"IanCox5","Comment","","The original construct was very Republican in nature. With the Federal delegates basically as indirect representatives. The Constitution itself was written by the states to the federal government representing ""we the people."" The states were situated as direct representatives, and local governments tended to be very democratic with little direct or indirect representation. 

Today most voting is done democratically with almost no indirect representation. Meaning the states no longer have representation and the federal government doesn't answer to the states but to each individual. 

Staggering the elections is a great national and domestic security measure. Nationally it ensures that there will always be experienced and ""in the know"" members of our government and not a starting completely over with information of the laws and foreign affairs. Domestically it makes sure that there is frequent attention drawn to each of the government bodies. The United States model I believe allows for greater influence by the voters to the government officials.

7739224,"Bhoward2","Comment","","Voting rates in Europe exceed those in the U.S. because European countries play an active role in empowering their citizens.  The example from the lecture was one of postal workers passing along information relating to a citizen's change of residence.  Other actions by governments overseas that make it easier to vote are ease of registration and opt-out rather than opt-in models.  In at least two countries, Australia and Belgium, failure to vote is punishable.  This is not believed to be a workable arrangement in the U.S. due to cultural factors.  Some other reasons to consider for low U.S. voting rates are apathy, convenience, distrust, and dislike.  

Convenience is the target of recent legislation in some states. This has the effect of disproportionately affecting young people, the disabled, minorities and the elderly.  These are often the poorest people in our society and they are the ones with limited mobility.  Specific ID requirements vary from state to state.  This has created roadblocks for many in the electorate.  Student ID's are no longer valid in Texas, while gun registrations are.  Some ID's require presentation of a birth certificate which can be costly and/or difficult to obtain (if you can't lay your hands on the original).  Some states have closed state offices such as the Department of Motor Vehicles, further restricting access.

States have also limited some previous conveniences such as same day registration and early voting hours.  Another less publicized practice is state voter purges which have the potential to eliminate vast numbers of the electorate in one fell swoop.

All of this is being done to address a problem that doesn't exist: in person voter fraud.  The statistics of this being an actual thing are astoundingly low.  Voter fraud in reality is far more likely to found in absentee voting and fraud on the part of election workers and/or rigged voting machines.

I can't resist a personal note here - this issue speaks strongly to me.  It's clear to me that these laws are clearly designed to try to ensure GOP victories.  They would lose on the demographics and the issues without the ability to stack the deck in their favor.

So far so good, but in 1981/82 there were three General Elections as no Government could retain majority support. A Taoiseach (Prime Minister) who retains the confidence of the Dail can seek, and get, a dissolution and a new General Election at any time. Furthermore, the Senate, which  has 60 members, has 11 members appointed by the Taoiseach,  6 elected by University graduates (but from only a handful of universities) and 43 indirectly elected on various vocational panels (Agricuture, Educational, Labour etc) by public representatives.

7825005,"nhungnt184","Comment","","**Q1: Why are voting rates in the United States lower than in Europe?** 

There are many reasons of this situation, including historic reasons and political/cultural reasons.

**Historic reasons**:

The original Constitution said nothing about the right to vote. The only clause related to voting was: each state had authority to determine voting eligibility. With this clause, most of states created its own regulation that denied women, slaves, the poor and the black the right to vote. So, the right to vote was implied the right of the white male who had (enough) property. 

Over the time, after many amendments and acts were ratified and many movements struggling for equality happened, those above who had been denied the right became eligible. Here are some:

+ The 14th Admendment, 1868: granted citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States,” 
+ The 15th Admendment, 1870: prohibited states from denying a citizen the right of vote based on his race or color
+ The 19th Admendment, 1920: granted the right to vote to women
+ Voting Right Act, 1965: temporarily banned the use of literacy tests which had been required for voters in some states.
+ The 24th Admendment, 1965: put to an end poll taxes which, like literacy tests, had been required for voters in some states.
+ 1970, literacy tests then were banned completely by Supreme Court.

**Political/cultural reasons**:

Registration laws stipulate that people who want to vote must registers to his state. The resposibility to register belongs to individuals, not to states as in European countries. It seems that the philosophy behind this is individualism and self-governing, two typical cultural characteristics of Americans.

Vote ID laws are the results of efforts to prevent voters from fraud. This is a political reason. In some states, this law is quite strict and people who have not had eligible vote ID yet tend not go to vote.

**Q2: Which demographic groups are most disadvantaged by U.S. voting laws? Why?**

Before the ratification of Voting Right Act, 1965, women and the black faced many barriers to practice their right to vote. 

Nowadays, things changed. No such barriers exist. 

Another groups, including the poor, the little educated and some minorities are most disadvantaged by U.S. voting laws. Vote ID laws require voter to have ID documents. The cost for this procedure is a problem to the poor. For the little educated, who are most likely to be unclear about things including procedures required and process of voting, their votes may not eligible.","","",NA,"","2015-09-16 20:01:00","2015-09-16 20:01:00","False","","55e5fb8701772be57d000de0","55f9caa601772be57d00199e",2,0

Currently, both the Senate and the House of Representatives are elected by popular vote.  The President is a combination of popular vote and the Electoral College (a system of state electors based on number of representatives in the House) where 270 electoral votes will select the President regardless of the popular votes.   
The parliamentary system where all the legislators are chosen in the same election seems to provide the voters the greater influence over lawmakers.   In one fell swoop, the entire composition and therefore the entire power can go from one party to another.  The American system, however, with its staggered elections keeps voters from making such drastic changes.  The party may lose some power depending on who is running in those election cycles but rarely do we see a complete swoop of one party representation in all of Congress or the Executive branch at the same time.  Therefore, the tyranny of the majority is in check with the American system.

For example blacks were at some time in the history of the country denied the right to vote as were women who were considered not to have the rightful palce in public affairs. The Constitution gave the state governments the authority to determine the voting eligibility in federal elections.

Early in the history of the US, males without property were denied the right to vote, while during the civil war voting was determined on the basis of colour. In the south in states like Louisiana literacy tests were deliberately organised to knock out some groups of people from voting; since voting was determined on the basis of passing these tests.

More European governments undertake the responsibility for registration of voters such that a voter moves to a different town or state, the postal authorities take it upon themselves to inform the Voting Registration officers of the change of address and to change the individual's registration with the result that 90% of eligible voters are registered. However, in the US the situation is different because it is the individual's duty to undertake the registration exercise by personally taking the time to register.

5269924,"Motivator","Comment","","When the Constitution was ratified and amended with the Bill of Rights there was no place in the world with more freedom than the United States. Nonetheless, the United States has become much more democratic thanks to the flexiblilty of amending the constitution. The 13th, 14th, 15th amendments were a step in the right direction, although the bad guys took over the local & state governments in the South that marginilized those amendements. The 17th and 19th amendments made the country much more democratic. 
As for the comparison to parlimentary elections compared to midterm and other elections, there are pros and cons. For one, the sheer number of elections spread out over time does put the political process in campaign mode where raising money is at the forefront, which is more a negative than positive. However, the issues are fluid--dynamic--they are always changing and that makes it elections relevent and exciting. But it is a complex issue for sure and it's a great question worth reflecting on. In closing, the brief biographcal sketch of Andrew Jackson was fascinating because of his 'rags to riches' rise to power and how he tried to make the country was democratic, which is to allow more people the opportunity to have a voice in the affairs of their country.

6643685,"HarryOne","Comment","","All forms of government—take your pick—have tendencies toward tyranny.  The proper task of founders is to design whatever government best fits their people in a way that makes tyranny will be less likely.  The spirit and habits of the American people would tolerate no form of government save a popular one. The particular pathology associated with popular government is “majority faction”, namely, a combination of individuals and interests that are able to dominate government and trample on the rights and interests of the minority. The task of the American framers then was to design a national government in a way that would make majority faction less likely. They did this by designing a ‘republican’ constitution. 

A republican constitution offers two design principles that make majority tyranny less likely. One, a defining feature of republican government is that the people elect representatives to govern in their name. This is different from a pure democracy where the people come together and directly decide public affairs. This different is not inconsequential. Because people elect representatives in a republican government, the size of the country can be much larger. This largeness multiplies the number of different interests in the republic. While majorities always govern, a majority in a large republic is less likely to be motivated by one passion or interest and to be a product of many compromises. Such majorities are more likely to be moderate and less of a threat to the liberty of minorities. 

The other design feature is basing the government on popular election but in both direct and indirect ways. In the US Constitution, the House of Representatives was elected directly by the people. This was important, since the legislature tends to be the most powerful branch and having a directly elected component would keep a popular tether on the direction of government. Still, as a safeguard against majority faction that might develop, the Senate by design was responsible to a different constituency, the state legislatures, and had longer terms (6 years), turning over slowly (a third every 2 years). Being once removed from the people and having longer terms was intended to foster a longer view by Senators and less susceptibility to a momentary majority passion. Finally, the Electoral College provided not for direct election of the President by the people—risking elections of charismatic demagogues—but by electors chosen again by the state legislatures who might be able to exercise an independent judgement of the public good.

Since the founding, the key nondemocratic features of the Constitution have been changed. As a result of the election of Andrew Jackson, state legislatures passed laws allocating electoral votes according to the popular vote. Additionally, the Senate is now directly elected by the people (17th Amendment in 1913).  

These changes in the American system do not make it as immediately responsive to popular sentiment as is the case with parliamentary democracies. Parliamentary democracies are based on a proportionate representation system that allocates representatives in parliament to the party that garners the most votes. Parties wining a majority have an immediate mandate and a clear path to govern. This is enhanced by the absence of the separation of powers, that is, by the fact that the executive is formed from the leading members of the elected legislature.

6643685,"HarryOne","Comment","","DaveDWA, yours is my understanding as well.  The short term and direct election of House members are meant to keep that branch close to the people. But there is a potential liability to that arrangement in engendering an immediate sensitivity to popular impulses. This is partly 'cured' through the longer term of the  Senate, which gives Senators the ability to take a longer view. They can, as it were, wait out the popular impulse, although not indefinitely, of course, since in 6 years the entire Senate will stand for reelection. A persistent popular view will prevail, but a persistent view is less likely to be reckless.

6643685,"HarryOne","Comment","","Yours is an excellent post. A forgotten element in the success of the American Constitution is not just the internal arrangements but also the size of the republic. In fact, James Madison says in Federalist #10 that the ""chief"" safeguard against the formation of tyranny of the majority (majority faction) is to multiply the many different interests in society by enlarging the republic. This makes it more likely that ruling majorities will only hang together through many compromises which tends to make them more moderate. This point creates perspective on the challenges that small nations have in trying to sustain democratic governments that respect the rights of minorities and engenders optimism about much larger counties, like India, which as a case in point benefits not only from the positive elements in its colonial past but also from its sheer size and diversity.

Now, we have direct influence over all three of these governing bodies.

In my opinion, the staggered system of elections we have is probably been more harmful than helpful. As we can see, Congress and the Presidency along with the Judicial branch being dominated by one party could easily start passing laws and resolutions under it's own agenda. The Parliamentary form where all these positions are elected at once, prevents influence from one of the bodies affecting the elections of another body. However, that might be a mistake to say, since there could be the off-chance that a previous congress of parliament is already dominated by a party... that party could look ahead to the future and supremely rig the elections for the next round by working together cleanly. I suppose there are pros and cons to each way of doing things. Ours causes more confusion, which, in itself, has probably prevented some harm. Slowing down the planning of each party to oust the other, and/or having to work harder to make it happen.","","",NA,"","2015-09-16 21:52:00","2015-09-16 21:52:00","False","","55e5fab49714b0b433000de8","55f9e4b501772bdebd001994",2,0

Today, the Presidency, House and Senate are subject to the vote of the people who have two chances to be heard, once in the primary, and once in the general election.  Although people seem to have acquired a more direct voice in the election process than before, the public's influence is diminished by partisan gerrymandering.

I think the staggered and separate elections in the United States do provide voters greater influence over lawmakers than a Parliamentary system because Americans vote more often and thus have more chances to voice their opinions.

7745189,"Djbaird","Comment","","The main reason that voting rates are lower in America than in Europe relates to where the responsibility lies for voter registration. In Europe, registration of voters is administered by the Government, which ensures a more uniform and systematic approach to voter registration.

In the American system, the onus for registration lies with the individual. In a lot of cases, this is not a bar to voter registration. Specifically, those that have the education, time, resources and necessary documentation to effect their own registration, often do. However, for poorly educated or disadvantaged people who may not be educated in the voter registration procedures, may be unable to attend the relevant offices and/or obtain the necessary identification documents, voter registration among these individuals is lower.

When the demographics of the typical Republican voter are examined (wealthy, educated), this results in a bias toward the Republican party. Given the Democrats appear to be disadvantaged by voter registration requirements (because of their voter demographic), it is very important to employ a less rigid and restrictive voter registration procedure to combat these issues. All United States citizens should be afforded an equal opportunity to vote for their representatives. The fact that special provisions/assistance may need to be provided to ensure certain demographics can access voter registration more easily is a natural result of a society with individuals of different means and backgrounds. In a country with non-compulsory voting, effort should be made to ensure that its representatives are elected by the people as a whole, rather than the privileged few.","","",NA,"","2015-09-17 00:25:00","2015-09-17 00:25:00","False","","55e5fb5c9714b07ea7000db4","55fa08639714b0069b001b7b",2,0

The staggered and separate elections makes the candidate busy with campaigning rather than serving for those who elected him. This also adds to the cost of campaigning and money is wasted rather than for country's benefit. 
Electing all legislators in same elections would definitely save time and money. Moreover it does not affect the voters influence over lawmakers. It stays the same.

My argument for this program is only in the fact that the technology is already available to anyone, anywhere in the world. Therefore, there must be digital tools to detect abnormalities caused by pornographers, pedophiles, rapists, murderers, terrorists, drug traffickers, corrupt politicians as well as criminals and traitors who represent a danger to society and that use electronic media and social networks to catch their victims.


On the other hand, limited government means that one institution can not exceed the power over the governed, that is, that the Constitution brand control mechanisms that power does not hurt or corrupted human rights and the right to privacy and freedom of expression are characteristic of a human being who is born and lives ""free"". So I am opposed to this program since the right of privacy claim.

2003550,"cirqueminime","Comment","","Because America has yet to awaken from its feudal dream, groggy from fantasies of men being Kings and their homes their castles, young women being glass-shod Princesses and young men Cavaliers on fiery steeds, Knights errant; the government still occupies a position on the pyramid of titled privilege just below the State Deity:  It is truly—or so Americans think themselves to be—One Nation Under God.  The chief purpose of a State Deity is to consecrate the Private Ownership of His land and its productive forces.  And from Him comes all Political Power, and that Power is meant only to glorify God.

This may seem, today, a parochial notion, fit for the likes of morbidly inbred Arkansas Baptists (white with foam) or officers of the Opus Dei—most hip Americans don’t cotton much to that God talk.  Yet from the time of the Founding Fathers, more critical inquiry into Human progress toward Freedom and away from Misery has been concerned with the democratic implications of The-One-True-and-Living-God than with the (anti-)democratic implications of Private Ownership of Socially productive Property.

As all past democracies have depended on a large body of cheap unto enslaved labor, a servant or toiling class, a (selectively) benevolent God has furnished an easy rationale for the inhuman, the subhuman, the abjectly unjust and morbidly wasteful exploitation of Human energies that have kept the U.S. in the game over the last two centuries.  The technological achievements of this ‘Owned’ class, in the service and at the whim of their Owners, have intensified human desperation and tighten its bondage.  Labor saving technology developed with Public resources accrues all benefits to its owners by reducing labor costs (time) and eliminating demand for workers.  

Yet to Understand the reactionary effects of religious or ethnic or tribal or even sexual sectarianism, of ‘identity-politics’, is a long way from abandoning it for Secularism, a key ingredient of all real Democracy. The First Amendment speaks of ‘Religious Freedom’ in the ‘Separation of Church and State’: but is this merely a freeing of the Church from bearing the costs (taxes) of governing, or did the Founders mean that there was no place for Religion, for Private superstitions, in the Discussion of the State’s functions? 

Throughout U.S. political history, Representation in government has gone to those whose interests were bound up in the feudalistic value-system of hierarchic privileges of Ownership that is the very ossature of Capitalism.  The government has always been of, by, and for the Owners of the National Wealth; only their interests, arguably, have been represented (until very recently) in the halls of government.  President Obama has racked public focus on a great mass of forgotten Americans.

After the Second American Revolution, aka the Civil War of 1861-1865, acknowledged the evil of and abolished chattel slavery in this country; it was a century before those workers, freed from the bondage of the Southern agriculture to become indentured to the wages of Northern Industry, would be allowed access to the nation’s electoral processes.  And as we know, even with a face of their own in the Master’s White House, the interests toiling class are now merely spoken of, and very quietly, at that, as they pertain to the advancement of the interests of their Private Owners.  As a symbol of the substantive failure of American Democracy, the current President is most eloquent.  Is impotent Representation Representation at all?

So to be Represented in the government means nothing if the interests (and the rights they sanction) of one’s class are excluded from the final discussion.

2003550,"cirqueminime","Comment","","Until recently—say, since the first Obama election--most Americans of every stripe have found electoral politics a barely tolerable—by now a perpetual--(no)talent spectacle, involving profoundly ignorant flacks, shabby salesmen, crooked businessmen, discussing issues of which they know naught, and all culminating in a media-wrangled beauty contest.  Somehow, no matter how seriously it is presented, the average citizen (who ever he or she is) understands at a chromosomal level that the real power over his life is elsewhere:  in the stars, in the tea leaves, in the Power Ball lottery, but not in the Spectacle of Electoral Politics.

Since Workers or Organized Labor have some time ago ceased to have political relevance in the U.S., I’ll call the disenfranchised the ‘Non-owners’, those whose only Property is the strength of their backs or the quickness and cunning of their wits, those whose interests have always been shunted aside by the Private Owners of Everything: these are the citizens who have been the least likely to get out and register and then search around for the nearest open polling station, and, finally, to vote. But when they do get out, as the Obama campaigns have shown they can, they make of the Democrats the closest thing this country has to a mass party.  And even with all the vote suppression the Republicans can muster, the Democratic Party could become America’s Ba’athist Party or United Russia.

But the American system is fraught with bypasses of the Public will, ways of getting around one-person-one-vote and majority rule.  These escape clauses, too, are being reined in by the Obama administration.

In sophisticated democracies, like those in Russia or Yugoslavia/Serbia, where suffrage is optimized by making the casting of a ballot easier that buying a bottle of slivovitz, there are rules that qualify elections as valid by the voter turnout they inspire.  Before NATO came to town to guarantee the installation of a comprador government in Belgrade and nullified the rule, any poll that was avoided by 50% of the electorate would be invalidated.  So, casting NO vote was a way of saying, “None of the Above.”  Until the Obama team came to DC, many Presidents were elected with a small plurality of the eligible voters—some even won with fewer popular votes than their opponent. 

In mass Democracies, with mass Parties, where the interests of the masses take precedence over those of the elite few, there is much greater interest in, and many more elections, than there are here.  But who should bear the responsibility for allowing politics in this country to drone on as a turgid soap opera with competing Personalities and Styles rather than conflicting policies and principles?  Who benefits and who suffers from mass suffrage?

It is a pseudo direct vote of the House, when some other body has to make the final decision, but apparently does so based on voter intention.  Is this just super bureaucracy gone mad?

In Australia, which is a Parliamentary system, but has a Senate, we do have staggered and separate elections for House (of Reps) members and the Senate (senators). In both cases its the direct people's vote. So in that regard our bicameral system is actually more advanced than the USA. So not all reps (House members and Senators) are elected at the same time.

But of course, we don't have an elected president. Funnily enough the media always goes on when a Prime Minister is dumped by their party that this is wrong because the PM was not elected. But it has never ever been the case of electing a PM anyway.

Presumably the more educated person are the more they tend to vote. So less educated, poorer persons may not vote or vote as often.  But it is probably not education per se that is the real factor, it is more likely that persons have reached some kind of moral and socio-economic awareness through the education that is causing them to act as voting citizens.

I felt compelled to vote because growing up I was aware that my father and grandfather were denied the right to vote in federal elections due to their race until the election of 1953. So I was the first generation to not be denied the right to vote in my family even though my family settled here legally over 100 years ago.

For most of my life Liberal governments have ruled until ten years ago when the electorate voted in an extreme right wing government that has ruled since. Because I vote at every election I didn't need to re-register until five years ago. For the first time in my life my name disappeared from the electoral rolls (no I did not move, I've lived at the same house for 30 years) so I had to go through a difficult process to re-register on election day when I found out my name was removed. That election was full of scandals over election fraud that had been perpetrated in a way that benefited the Conservative vote (lookup Robocall Scandal where liberal voters received robocalls redirecting them to the wrong polling stations in tight ridings) People should have gone to jail for this but didn't. I never received any answers as to why my name disappeared from the election rolls but after five years of the Conservatives running the election machinery I blame them for many names being dropped and being forced to re-register at the last minute.

In my experience Conservatives prefer to take away the vote from people whereas Liberals benefit from more people having the vote.

8078165,"mjwells555","Comment","","In the original system of voting under the US Constitution, the only direct vote that the people had was for the House of Representatives.  The Senate was chosen by the State Legislatures, and the President was elected by the Electoral College, which was the total number of representatives plus the two Senators that each state had.  Under President Andrew Jackson the Electoral College vote was tied to popular vote, giving the people more of a direct influence in the Presidential election.  The 17th Amendment, ratified in 1913, gave the people a direct vote for the Senators from their state.

It is still debated whether the people have more control over the elections with direct votes for both the House and Senate and the Electoral College tied to the popular vote of each state with the Presidential Elections.  Today, elections cost more money than they ever did.  Many wealthy and affluent people from outside districts or even the state give money to campaigns, to sway influence the outcomes of the elections.  Also, districts are altered every ten years, mostly by the State Legislatures.  The parties in power in the State Capitols, use this to their advantage in national elections to make many Congressional districts out of reach for the other party. 

Still, the United States has more of a direct election system, compared to most parliamentarian systems of governments.  In most parliamentarian governments, the people vote for a political party, and the parties then pick the candidates they desire to represent them and the people.  In the United States, the people vote directly for both their Congressman and Senator.  Also, the staggered elections in the US help give the people more of an influence over their elected officials.  House members are elected every 2 years, and all of the 465 members run for election at the same time.  A senators term is 6 years, with only one-third of the Senate up for election every two years.  This system of elections makes House Members more listen more to the desires of the people in their districts.  Senators have more freedom to vote against bills that they see as unfit or harmful as laws.  Six years is a long time in politics, and people tend to forget what a Senator voted for 5 years before.  This system of staggered elections combined with Americans directly voting for their elected officials, gives the people more influence over their government than that of a parliamentary system.","","",NA,"","2015-09-17 07:54:00","2015-09-17 07:54:00","False","","55e5fab49714b0b433000de8","55fa71a301772bc995001b36",2,0

Voters, at the beginning of the Constitution act, didn't have a complete participation when it came down to the election of their representatives. This on the first place, is how the concept of democracy evolved to a more specific and complex one: republic. 

Now days Americans have the right to vote for the Senate as well as for the President of the US; this being a way to stop a good idea from becoming a bad one. Changes where made in order for a new born democracy not to turn up into a known aristocracy. People now days have the complete right to choose every national representative, this being a real form of a republic, in contrast with the old system, in which they where not allowed to choose their Senators and not even their most representative form: the President itself.

In contrast with the European system, the American system, provides the best complete example of a democratic republic. This is simply because voters are involved in major ways and there's a real active participation of the people.

Though the president is still alected by an electoral college, the votes of the college go to the candidate that has won the popular vote. So since Jackson the people also have a voice in presidential elections.
The candidate of each party to the presidency is also now the result of primaries conducted in each state.
So indeed there is more people direct representativity at both levels.
Yet each election is an opportunity for the candidates or the legislature to try and trick the system, and for lobbies to influence the outcome through funding one or the other candidate.

1566755,"DStanton","Comment","","Originally, the U.S. general public had a more fractional role in the election of federal legislators - while they could directly vote for their House Representatives, Senators were appointed by the state legislature (whose members were elected by the people of that state). Senate elections were transformed to come directly from the people with the 17th Amendment, providing for more direct representation.

Similarly, state legislatures originally had more power over determining the voter pool by setting loosely-bounded limits on eligibility, such as the metrics of property-ownership or ability to pay poll taxes and pass restrictive voter assessments. Supreme Court rulings have since introduced greater limits on these restrictive measures, though the debate over what level of voter-pool regulation is appropriate continues.

The parliamentary system (voters choose a representative governing body en masse) is generally seen as allowing greater influence over lawmakers than the U.S. system of staggered elections (voters choose a portion of the governing body in each election cycle). This is essentially because a parliamentary election provides the opportunity to ""throw [ALL of] the bums out"" per election versus a staggered election cycle that provides the opportunity to ""throw [SOME of] the bums out"".

Arguments can be provided in favor of either system - a parliamentary system can provide more opportunity to renew the governing institution, while a staggered system can provide greater continuity of legislative activity (or lack thereof, as the case may be).

The introduction of primary elections has also increased direct voting.

The staggered system of elections should increase the influence of voters as there is always an election coming. Therefore, the parties are going to always be listening to the voters. However, there is a downside to this - politics can be dominated by electioneering rather than legislating and governing. It is also more likely to result in the different institutions being controlled by different political parties - which can result in gridlock. However, if you take the parliamentary system in the UK it now seems to mean that a political party will gain full control with less than 40% of the votes.

Today the Great Compromise decision has been adopted to create a two chambered house in which the voters would be involved in direct election of the House of representatives and the senators.The Senate would have two members per state, chosen by the state legislatures for six-year terms; an arrangement satisfied the concerns of small states. Past attempts to have a direct election of the President by the people was shot down by congress and instead what came to be adopted was the Electoral College which was based on each state having as many electors as it had members of Congress, House and Senate combined and the state legislatures would choose the electors,and the candidate with the majority of the electoral votes would become president.

The US system of having separate elections for each of the of the officials whether in the House, Senate and President through the electrol college has been held to be democratic but has been criticized for leading to a phenomenon called gerrymandering and redistricting and denying people direct vote for the president. It can lead to corruption.

The Parliamentary system lacks any gerrymandering  in developing nations like Kenya where the President is directly elected by the people

1241001,"cdt071","Comment","","One of the early changes to the electoral process was that of eliminating a property ownership requirement for eligibility to vote, which served as an important shift in broadening the electorate base away from only propertied and wealthy individuals. Other significant changes have included the tying of votes cast by the Electoral College to the popular vote gained by the presidential candidate within each state, and the passage of a constitutional amendment providing for the popular election of senators -- both of which changes allowed for a more direct voice by the people as to who represented them in the federal government. 

Early restrictions that disenfranchised a large percentage of the population have since been removed. The 15th Amendment secured the right to vote for African-Americans. The Voting Rights of 1965 targeted ongoing efforts to limit the voting rights of minorities. Voting rights were granted to women, and the 24th Amendment eliminated poll taxes. As a result, a greater number of citizens have a more direct say in elections today, however, there is still room for improvement. Reforms are needed to the Electoral College, campaign financing and regulations, and the primary process, in order to further democratize the process.

The staggered nature of the US electoral schedule versus the single periodic election of parliamentary systems allows for changes to be made in the representative body more swiftly if voters are dissatisfied with the ruling party(s) actions. Voters in the US have greater influence over elected officials, who must remain constantly aware that the tide can shift at the next election if they are not receptive to the wishes of the electorate, particularly with the Executive and Legislative elected separately. The downside to staggered elections is that much decision-making revolves around the election cycle, party politics and re-election, more so than the long term best interests of the nation.","","",NA,"","2015-09-17 12:56:00","2015-09-17 12:56:00","False","","55e5fa6201772bc852000dac","55fab8819714b0c98d001b28",2,0

1241001,"cdt071","Comment","","One possible reason for lower voter turnout in the US than in Europe is the lack of automatic voter registration as practiced in many European countries. The US registration process can prove a deterrent for many voters, where transportation, awareness of the process, and potential costs (such as in procuring a photo ID), often serve as obstacles. Initiatives such the Motor Voter Act, which facilitates easier registration, have shown positive results, suggesting that registration is in fact part of the problem in participation. Voter eligibility rules are set by states and have therefore been prone to manipulation based on demographics and the objectives of the party in power -- such as seen in the recent spate of voter-ID registration rules implemented by Republican-controlled states to hinder voting by minorities and the poor who are more likely to vote Democrat.

There is also an historical component to low turnout, in that for decades a large portion of the population were restrained from voting through laws and practices that did little to uphold the principle of one person, one vote. African Americans and women were long denied the right to vote, and outside of such direct prohibitions, property ownership requirements, literacy tests, poll taxes, and other obstacles served to make the opportunity to vote inaccessible to many. Unlike such basic concepts as freedom of speech and the right to bear arms, for example, the right (duty?) to vote appears to have been given less support in early US political culture and therefore may not have become quite as ingrained in political thought and action as many of the other founding concepts, particularly for minorities and lower income groups.

Finally, voter dissatisfaction may have something to do with low voter turnout. In a highly polarized two-party system, such as that of the US, many times there is a sense that voting is for the ""less bad"" of two choices, neither of which aligns completely with the voter's interests and needs. Feeling that politicians are in general acting in their own best interests, and that little will change in the status quo, regardless of which party/candidate takes office, may lead to a general voter apathy. In a multi-party system, there are more choices and a greater likelihood of finding a candidate to whom a voter can best relate.","","",NA,"","2015-09-17 13:34:00","2015-09-17 13:34:00","False","","55e5fb5c9714b07ea7000db4","55fac1669714b0f1ff0006d3",2,0

Of course this scenario benefices Democrats. On the other hand, shrink  the population of voters with some kind of test or payment will increase the proportion in people (with high income) and this situation benefices Republicans. Second, in Europe the registration is made by the government which have the responsibility to registry all voters. 
The demographic groups is certainly the less benefited financially, as was said before the level of income employ a huge influence in the system. Once the rules as developed to difficult some group (like taxes or tests) certainly this group will be most disadvantaged.

2159052,"Larryluca","Comment","","Voting rates are lower in the US than in other developed country democracies for three reasons. First of all, the proportion of eligible voters who are registered is lower, 75%, compared to much higher elsewhere. This is because the US requires each citizen to be responsible for maintaining their voter registration where other countries make it a government responsibility. Second, many US states and counties impose restrictive voter registration rules, limited voter registration office hours, limited voting hours and limited voting capacity. And third, and most important, many American voters feel their vote does not matter or they feel that no matter who is elected the American system is not favorable to them and they have no chance of changing it.

Restrictive voting rules and arrangements are intended and apparently succeed in suppressing votes of racial and ethnic minorities, youth and women. This most likely occurs because these are people who have difficulty taking time off from work to register or to vote, have limited funds and don't want to spend the money to travel to register or vote, or who most feel that the American system does not give them opportunity.","","",NA,"","2015-09-17 16:55:00","2015-09-17 16:55:00","False","","55e5fb5c9714b07ea7000db4","55faf0679714b01c9d001b7e",2,0

8153248,"EduardoLHernandezCalo","Comment","","The framers of the Constitution included in Article I, section 3, “The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state, chosen by the legislature thereof for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote.” They thought that by having this kind of selection, senators would be able to concentrate on the business at hand without pressure from the populace. Nevertheless, history tells us that their noble intention soon became a contentious battleground were bribery and intimidation marked some of the states’ selection processes (Direct Election of Senator, Online Article). The government soon realized that reform was inevitable in order to preserve stability to our relatively new democracy. States, such as Oregon and Nebraska, started to implement different measures for senators’ selection. The most widely discussed during the time was direct elections. In spite of senate member’s disapproval, reforms took place as the 17th amendment passed through congress during 1912. The amendment gave power to the people to select their senators from their representative state, acquiring a more direct voice and involvement.  

The current U.S. system of staggered and separate elections for House members, senators, and the president, provides an idea of how can voters influence more directly their lawmakers. For instance, let’s approach a psychological point of view. If you are selected for a two-year term, as House members, you’ll know that everything you do, for good or bad, will be more likely to persist in the mind of voters. Whereas, Senate members obtain a 6-year term which helps them persuade public opinion over the years if a policy they legislated ended up to be unpopular for those who he represent. The system we have clearly favor senators since they have a secured position for as long as 6 years in order to reestablish voters’ confident if at some point they underperformed. For the best interest of the people, it is ideal to choose their representatives as it occurs at the House, every 2 years, so they will have the power to change faster if required.

8153248,"EduardoLHernandezCalo","Comment","","To profoundly understand why voting rates in the United States are lower than in Europe we would have to dissect two equally important topics: a country’s history and voting regulations. In America, we occasionally take democracy for granted; primarily because we haven’t had a dictator ruling over our people as he pleases. Most of European countries, at some point of their history, had an authoritarian ruler as Napoleon (France), Hitler (Germany), Franco (Spain), Mussolini (Italy), Stalin (Russia) and Ceaușescu (Rumania), just to mention a few of them. In this case, Europeans take elections very seriously. They are aware how much they have progressed to obtain a righteous government who ensures their democratic involvement and human rights. As an American, we need to participate as much as we can during election polls. People might think that one vote does not change an election, yet it is vital for our meaningful democracy to express our political opinion and exercise our political franchise. Currently, many countries around the world cannot vote for a political change, however we can because our precious democracy reigns in our blessed country. 

Voting registration affects the most vulnerable, underrepresented communities. This topic cement their ties with Voter ID Laws since they both contribute to our lower voting rates in America. Let’s first take into consideration how registration works in the United States. In the US it is an individual responsibility to register and notify, as well as, if the person changes address. As compared with Europe, that responsibility lies in the hands of the government. By doing so, it strengthens voting poll rates since they make it easier for their citizens to simply go to their voting area and summit their ballot. The question now is why do we complicate the system to our voting citizens? Easy, it’s just a political scheme to win elections. Voter ID Laws requires every voting citizen to provide a government-issue identification such as driver’s license or passport in order to prevent non-citizen from voting (voter fraud). However, what we really know it’s that minorities groups, x < 35,000 salary income families, African Americans and 18-24 year olds will be more likely to not have the means to provide an ID for them to vote. These groups would be tend to vote democratic and by having those out of the polls ensure republicans to win elections. It was not until the 1993 Motor Voter Act, which gave voters registration whenever they apply for a driver license or public assistance. This have contributed to increase voting rates, but we still have a long run to increase those percentages.

Maybe the US with its many elections suffer from the same problem, that there is to much the citizens don't know about or care about and that it takes up to much time from the daily life and to little daily effect for them to invest time into the election and actually vote. If it won't directly affect you, you probably won't care.

I definitely oppose the NSA program.

8172215,"andylewis10","Comment","","Voting rates may be lower in the US than in some European countries because some (but not all) of the latter register voters automatically and do not expect voters to register themselves, as is US practice (this doesn’t apply to all European countries – in the UK, for example, there is no requirement to register or automatic process but the process is made easy and it is quite difficult to obtain services such as credit and banking if your name and address cannot be found on the electoral roll). 

However I don’t feel that this is the entire answer as to the difference in voting rates. It may be that the generally larger role which government plays in terms of social service and welfare provision encourages European voters to vote at higher rates and of course democracy may be seen as more vital to participate in within countries which have a history of repression or instability (e.g. Eastern Europe and the Balkans).

Demographic groups which are poorer in socio economic terms are less likely to vote in the US. This may be because of factors such as voter ID laws – poorer people are generally less likely to have access to the required form of ID. However it may also be that people in these groups have less opportunity to vote (e.g. due to lack of transport) or may not be as engaged with local politics due to changing address more frequently.

The Supreme Court found that the fine was equivalent to a tax and within the power of the government. The government also proposed that ""free riders"" should not be able to take advantage of state requirements to provide medical treatment whether or not covered by insurance and therefore everyone should be required to have insurance. This also was approved by the Supreme Court.

In my view, everyone should be required to have insurance from birth, obviously included in parents' insurance until the person reaches an age of ""maturity."" We have in every state laws that require health care providers to take care of anyone with a medical emergency. These laws were passed in the 1970s after much experience of sick and injured people being left on streets or dumped somewhere where they got no care. Now many people, especially youth and poor, know that they will be cared for even when they cannot pay. They need to be required to pay. Those that are unable to pay for insurance should be subsidized. We should provide basic health care for all for three reasons. 1) a healthier population is more productive and well workers contribute to us all while sick people are a drain; 2) we can reduce overall costs of health care by detecting and treating conditions earlier and 3) we morally should not allow people to suffer from treatable illnesses and conditions. I recognize that some treatments are excessively costly and often prolong a life for just a short while. Therefore I believe government support should be limited in dollar amount per case and by requiring that treatment be expected to be effective for a minimum amount of time such as 12 months.

This annotated version of the Constitution provides the original text  with commentary about the meaning of the original text and how it has changed since 1789

8054533,"DNA_Shadow","Comment","","Now that Congress has actually reviewed and debated the NSA program, and passed new legislation that authorizes and places limits on the program, it is technically a legal program.  In that sense, it is harder to immediately oppose it - especially since limits have been placed, such as the requirement for the NSA to obtain a warrant if they have reasonable suspicion of terrorist activity based on patterns in the data.  In addition, under the new law the data is retained by telecommunications companies, rather than the NSA itself, which adds another level of separation between the government and the private communications of the public.  The 2015 law passed by Congress returned the issue to the stage of limited government, where it was and continues to be subject to scrutiny and checks from the three branches of government.  Notably, the Supreme Court now has the right to interpret this law and deem whether or not it is constitutional - a role which Kentucky Senator Rand Paul hopes it will fulfill by striking down the law.

So while the program is now ostensibly legal and part of the limited government system, it is still troubling, and definitely embodies the tension in modern America between the desire for limited government, and the desire for national security.  Whether or not the simple act of monitoring the public’s telephone and internet overall traffic (not individual content) constitutes an invasion of privacy is ambiguous.  That being said, as data breach after data breach demonstrates, information on the internet should never be trusted as entirely private or safe - whether from the US government, foreign governments, or private hackers.  Indeed, an additional lesson can be drawn from the Edward Snowden leak that even the CIA’s secrets could be compromised by the actions of a low-level contractor.  In light of these realities, one could argue that the NSA might as well have the power to monitor information which private hackers could conceivably obtain anyway. 

My ultimate reservation is that viewing the telephone and internet traffic of private telecommunications companies seems like that in itself should require a search warrant, because that information would not normally be observable; it would not be “in plain view.”  At the very least, the government could be required to obtain consent from the individual company to conduct this preliminary look at the telecommunications traffic records - then at least ordinary citizens would have a say over which companies they would support, if some cooperated with the NSA and others did not.  In the current 2015 law, the NSA can monitor the traffic recorded by the companies in order to look for evidence of terrorist activity, then if suspicion arises, a request can be sought.  

To me, it seems like the more constitutional route to take would be requiring a preliminary permission, or at least consent from the company, first to observe traffic records, and then if suspicious patterns are detected a further warrant could be sought.  The inherent flaw even with this proposal is that once the NSA is looking at traffic records, it is a broadly sweeping search that affects every person who has records stored with the company.  In other words, the NSA doesn’t have to have reason to suspect any particular person.  This non-specific searching enters a gray area regarding the Fourth Amendment’s line “no Warrants shall issue, but upon probably cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”

In the end, I think it does come down on some level with whether you prefer to emphasize national security or limited government.  The NSA program is clearly invasive, regardless of constitutionality.  Possibly of more importance, now that there is a law that can be interpreted and regulated regarding the NSA surveillance program, is ensuring due process for anyone who is suspected of a crime based on evidence gathered from the NSA.  In other words, not detaining people without a trial and not shipping people out of the US to Guantanamo where legal protections are much weaker.","","",NA,"","2015-09-17 21:34:00","2015-09-17 21:34:00","False","","55e5f9b09714b08e1a000e1f","55fb31da01772b83ae001d49",2,0

Use of this system is predicated on the inability of a state to fund its own bills. States take Medicaid, for example, because they don't want to pay for their poor to get healthcare themselves. It's expensive and unpopular, but a humanitarian necessity.

The reality is, though, it's a terrible bargain. Accountability for how the money is acquired and spent disappears into a multilevel bureaucratic mess. The effect is to some extent an expansion of federal authority, but also a sense of laziness and failed governance on the part of the states. It may be that some transient aid is necessary from time to time, but a state should be able to balance its own budget.

into the policy areas traditionally reserved for the states. The reason for granting these funds include the federal government's need for intervening in health care, public housing, welfare assistance, education. And it has the intention of using federal power to help working families and the economically vulnerable.

This intention gives purpose to Congress' power to determine how states and localities may use these federal grants-in-aid, as they must solely be used for their pre-specified objective, such as a block grant for education, which means that a state may use the grants-in-aid in whatsoever aspect of education they wish to fund but the money must only be used for this particular sector.

When it comes to federal grants-in-aid for welfare assistance the implications resulted in several Americans choosing to remain in the welfare system instead of going to work.

6262960,"JAFuentesZapata","Comment","","In regards to the commerce clause, the Obama administration stated that the uninsured
imposed a cost on the nation's economy. As when they become sick, they still go to the emergency room, and this cost is being paid by the hospital, which then passes the cost along to other patients. Therefore, this aspect should be regulated by Congress. The Court refuted this argument by stating that ""the commerce clause authorizes Congress to regulate interstate commerce, not to order individuals to engage in it"". 

Nevertheless, the Court upheld the Affodable Care Act by stating that, in the end, Congress' power to tax (taxing and spending clause) was effective at regulating such a case, therefore,  it gave Congress the authority to impose the individual insurance mandate.

The taxing and spending clause was not necessarily any more clarifying or proper to justify the upholding of the Affordable Care Act than would have been the commerce clause, I do believe it is the individual's decision to decide whether or not to pay for health insurance. Especially if that person pays their taxes. But I do support that individuals should engage in economic activity or be in the process of doing so (studying, preparing etc.) unless they're retired, severely disabled or effectively dead.
Hence, although it is perhaps unconstitutional, I would have agreed on justifying Congress' authority through the commerce clause. 

But evidently this would conflict with the fact that, as the Court said; ""the commerce clause authorizes Congress to regulate interstate commerce, not to order individuals to engage in it"".

These include the use of the electoral college, gerrymandering, advantages for wealthy candidates and access to voting systems for minority and low socioeconomic groups. In Australia, voting is compulsory and members of the house of reps and the senate are voted for 4 or 6 year terms directly by the people. Whilst we still have party politics at play, particularly in relation to the two-party preferred vote, I see this as far more democratic. Governments are always brought back to centre on policy issues otherwise they do not retain the public vote. This protects us from the mobilisation of far right or far left wing factions. However, our Government is also known to get gridlocked, where there is no clear majority and there is a hung parliament. However this does force the two parties to negotiate more. While I know less about it, I like the Danish Government system as it seems to require far more compromise and therefore reflects a much broader demographic of the population.

8051355,"IsmaelMJose","Comment","","In the original US election system, the President and the Senators were elected only indirectly by the people through the State legislatures in contrast with members of the House of Representatives who are elected directly by the people. The framers of the Constitution believed that if federal officials were elected by the populace, it would permit the majority to trample on the minority. But as it happened, it only created a more precarious national government. The system resulted in a representative government chosen by the privileged few and who is remotely beholden to the people. The President and Senators could take measures that do not reflect the best interests of the majority of people. In effect, the fears of the framers of the Constitution happened but in reverse: the few had power over the many. In this system, the people had less direct voice in the election process.  But after a long and arduous road, the Constitution had been amended and now allows the people a more direct voice in the US election system. In present day America, the President, Senators and Congressmen are now elected directly by the people in the polling booths.  In fact, with the invention of the primary election, the people now directly determines both who could run and who could win these offices.   

The old US election system is in a way similar with a parliamentary system where a head of state is elected only by the legislature and not directly by the people.  In essence, therefore, the voters have greater influence under the present day US election system compared to a parliamentary system. Also, because there are staggered and separate elections in the US, the voters have more opportunity to influence lawmakers.  For example, those who disagree with how a particular party-led administration runs the government can show it in the coming elections by voting for the apposing party candidates.

The reasons why voting rates in the US is lower than in Europe are the following:  
a. Historically, not all Americans were  granted the right to vote in the original Constitution. In fact, the Constitution did not grant the right to vote at all. 
b.  The original Constitution left to the states the power to determine voter eligibility in federal elections, the only limitation being that said  rules be not more stringent than those it applies to the election in the  largest chambers in the states. This allowed the states to pass voting restrictions that effectively curtailed voting rights. For example, the property requirement (voting right based on property held), literacy tests (which only whites pass), gender requirement (only males could vote). Under these regulations, blacks, women and minorities have not been allowed to vote. These were the demographics that are most disadvantaged by US voting laws.  In fact, it was only at the turn of the 20th century that these demographics were slowly allowed access to the ballot. At present day, the US election is far from perfect.  Laws on voter id's and gerrymandering are the new tools used in politics to affect the election outcomes, an in effect, the rights of the people.

First, in the United States, individuals have the responsibility to register for elections whereas in Europe, it is the government's responsibility. In 1993, the Motor Voter Act ensured that applicants for a driver's licence be registered at the same time. 

Second, the eligibility rules differ as well. A controversial topic in the US revolves around the Voter ID laws enacted in different states. Voters are required to show a formal ID, which makes it more difficult for the people who have no form al ID - either because of the lack of access or the costs associated with an ID - to participate in elections. Opponents to the Voter ID law contend that the law has a suppressive effect by reduced the size of voters and giving more voice to one party in the US. The law disadvantages the poor, the young and the minorities. Advocates highlight the need to keep public's faith in the integrity in the ballot and the need to deter 'frauders' from manipulating the elections.","","",NA,"","2015-09-18 06:47:00","2015-09-18 06:47:00","False","","55e5fb5c9714b07ea7000db4","55fbb39b9714b02743001bca",2,0

7580394,"Mahwishmoazzam","Comment","","Federal grant in aid has played a major role in expansion of federal government’s authority. The theory behind grants-in-aid is that the federal government can create subsidy programs in the national interest to efficiently solve local problems. As far as the acceptance of grant in aid in concern, no state is compelled to receive it but if a state gets this aid it is bound by the federal requirements for its use.
During the period of financial crisis, when Americas were looking towards federal government for help, the grant in aid became the primary instrument of the great society. The federal government grants the money with some requirements so that money cannot be misused by local authority and the most important justification may be that owner of the money has a power to control the way and mode of spending money. Federal government being the owner of grant in aid is justified to set the conditions and requirement for spending of money.

The main argument behind the Affodable Care Act was that uninsured people imposed a cost on the economy (through costs passed along to other patients in hospitals) and therefore Congress had the right to regulate the matter. The court agreed that Congress could use the Commerce Clause to regulate interstate business but had no right to compel individuals to buy insurance coverage.The court upheld the Affodable Care Act due to its interpretation related to the Taxing and Spending clause. Much time was spent debating whether it was a tax or a penalty but in the end, Congress was authorise to impose the individual insurance mandate.

I believe that the Necessary and Proper Clause gives the federal government a range array of power nowadays. Technology has changed how we operate and as a result I would given the same interpretation as the Court. The insurance premium could be called a penalty or a tax, at the end of the day it represents a transfer of money ordered by the federal government and collected for a particular purpose. Therefore I think that invoking the Taxing and Spending Clause makes a stronger case for the Affordable care Act.

The 2nd original system is ""CONSTITUTION OF 1787"" based on the Virginia's Plan: 3 branches Executive, Legislative, and Judiciary (Check and Balance). LEGISLATIVE: The Congress made up of 2 houses, considered as the center piece of government: Lower House: elected by people for 2 year term; proportional to population. Upper House: members selected from nomination by States, via Lower House. EXECUTIVE: assumed by the Legislative branch. JUDICIARY: Supreme Court plus some inferior Courts. COUNCIL of REVISION: executive members + judiciary members. But the Constitution was still not workable. The ""CONNECTICUT COMPROMISE"" was accepted: Lower House: elected by people, 2 year term, based on population. Upper House: elected by States for 6 year term. Executive: Chief of Executive elected by College of Electors chosen in each State. Judiciary: justices appointed. TODAY GOVERNMENT: Government based on Reviewed Constitution 1787. Elections: PRIMARY: candidate to run for general elections chosen by political parties through their members. GENERAL: Federal/state/local elections. Candidates running as independent from political parties (!) MID-TERM: every 2 years to vote for House of Representatives and 1/3 of Senate. Voters will selct also official state, and local government posts. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: elected for 2 year term, proportionaly to population of state, elected by people. SENATE: 6 year-term elected by people, 1/3 replaced in mid-term elections. EXECUTIVE: President elected by Electoral College for 4 year term as the Vice-President. ELECTORAL COLLEGE: same number of members as the state has in the Congress, elected by States. If President has not the majority, election decided by House of Representatives; if vice President has not the majority, election decided by Senate. JUDICIARY: appointed and controlled by President, approved by Congress. PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM: there are many different governments under this system, Executive and legislative are interconnected. Generally the Head of State is different from the Head of Government for exemple the British system: the Head of State is the Queen or King, the Head of Government is the Prime Minister who is really in charge of the country, the Head of State being here in a role of consultant! In France, it is an hybrid system, with the President being the head of State and a Prime Minister, the Head of the government sitting in the Chambre des Deputes during sessions. It is a bicameral system with 2 Houses: House of Representatives (Deputes) and a Senate. EXECUTIVE: President elected for 5 year term (before it was 7 long years!) by the citizens in 1 round voting. He is the Commander in chief of the Armies. LEGISLATIVE: House of Representatives or National Assembly, 577 members elected for 5 year term in a single seat contituencies by people; election 2 round runoff voting. Senate: 348 members: 328 elected by electoral college of representatives from each department; 8 of which are elected from other dependencies; 12 of which are elected by the French Assembly of French Citizens Abroad. French people vote for European Elections, local elections,Referendum. JUDICIAL: independent from the other two, based on civil law (Napoleonic Code), justices are appointed by executive branch and approved by special panel High Council of the Judiciary? Justices serve for life. I think that Parliamentary system as in France, provides voters with a greater influence over the lawmakers because they vote for the executive and legislative branches both involved in the lawmaking.","","",NA,"","2015-09-18 09:04:00","2015-09-18 09:04:00","False","","55e5fab49714b0b433000de8","55fbd3ba01772bdebd001ad2",2,0

Still, the system was more or less applied and copied until Andrew Jackson, ex-military who served brilliantly during the revolutionary war of 1812 became the 7th president of the United States Of America. Born and raised poor, he fought to instore laws so the people can have the right to vote. He failed as his attempts were rejected by the govermnent several times.

But he opened some doors, and the idea made its way... We are now in 1940's, in the southern states. At the time, only male and white with a declared property had the right to vote. On the top of it, voters had to take a literacy test and pay a tax poll in order to obtain this right.

Ten years later, came the Grand Father rule where any child or grand child of a voter was exempted of paying the tax. Not it is to mention that the literacy test was very tough to pass, unless for a very educated man. We understand here that voting was reserved to the upper class.

As years passed, laws changed as we know it. The 14th and 20th amendments were rated by the Supreme Court and any american citizen can vote as long as he has registered for it and possesses a valid ID. 

If we could take a closer look to the midterm election (2014) we could see that black and white voters participated equally, and black voters went to polls in majority in 2012 for the presidential election. 

We can then state then that voters have acquired a more direct voice in the election process than back in the days.

This direct vote is also used to elect House members, for a two years term , the numbers of representatives are proportioned to the size of each State. The senators (two per any of the fifty states) are elected by the legislators for six years. 


Regarding the presidential election, we use both system in the USA, direct and indirect.

The two parties, both democrats and republicans, will organise a vote strictly reserved to its members which is denominated the primary election. Following this, will surge a nominee upon all the senators who have runned for it.
Let's imagine that the current surveys are rights, we should see then Hillary Clinton representing the Democrats and Donald Trump the Republicans. Both would run for the Presidency of the USA. The final election would occur in November 2016, the great voters (government representatives of each state and each party) would vote for the candidate of their choice. This is what commonly called as the indirect election.


As opposed to it, the direct one then, used to elect the governor of the State for example, would be the system which provides voters greater influence over lawmaker, as they should decide directly by a simple vote without any intermediate representative voter.

Senators were selected or elected by individual state legislators (2 per State with staggerd terms) and the President was elected by an Electoral College with each state having electors equal to their total number of Representatives plus 2 Senators.  

Prior to the 17th Amendment to the Constitution which made election of Senators by popular vote law of the land a few states in essence held direct elections for the Senate.  Some states were largely one party states and held political primaries for the Senate.  Whichever candidate one the primary of the major party generally was selected to serve the state in the Senate.  If I recall correctly (and I am doing this from memory which is always prone to hazard) other states held direct elections which were binding on the State Legislators.  So even though the process was not officially changed, some states elected their Senators directly prior to passage of the 17th Amendment.

The Electoral College elected our first President and elects the President today with one change being that today a popular election is held for President and each state assigns electors based on the outcome of that election within its own boundaries.  So while our President is not today elected directly by popular vote (which sometimes is open to questionable results and subsequent debate) the electoral college does to some extent reflect the popular vote.  

It is interesting to me that one reason some individuals disliked the first method of selecting US Senators were complaints that the Senate was a ""millionaire's club"".  Today, of course, we often discuss the fact that our modern US Senate is ... well, a ""millionaire's club!""

I honestly do not know which system offers voters greater influence over lawmakers.  For me a great deal of mathematical research and study and surveys would be necessary to draw significant empirical conclusions and even then I would want to understand the process where individuals came to be involved in politics and in one party or another in the first instance.  Political Parties are a part of the system  - as is money or wealth - and the size of our elections calls into question (in my opinion) actual influence voters have over ""lawmakers"".  In this section the professor has asked to some extent ""how much democracy do we want?""  Do we want a tyranny of Democracy where mob rule influences elections?  And then when is labeling one group or another ""mob rule"" actually a propaganda tool for another ""mob""?  

Many parliamentary systems have a Monarch of some sort who - even though they are generally regarded in this era as symbolic in many instances such as in the UK - it seems to me could step in and make necessary ""adjustments"" should they deem Parliament to be out of bounds.  Our system has elections on 2 year, 4 year and 6 year cycles so that a relatively stable Senate might be able to withstand and minimize temporary shocks of some radical shift in voter sentiment even if the President and House of Representatives were to change.  But honestly, while I prefer our system as a matter of education and experience, I put this question on a personal level and I am not certain if I would have any more influence in our American System than I would have in a Parliament.","","",NA,"","2015-09-18 12:46:00","2015-09-18 12:46:00","False","","55e5fa6201772bc852000dac","55fc07b69714b0c98d001c21",2,0

 'in the court’s 2012 NFIB v.

The staggered cycle is so that we still have 6 year Senate terms, to act as a ""cooling plate"" for the hotheads in the House. Then, 16 years in, we hit the ""reset"" button, and start the whole circus over again. (All of this is a thought experiment, carried to it's logically absurd conclusion.)

In my classes, I start the ""term limits"" discussion with the Dingell/Byrd examples, and ask whether there should be people serving in Congress for 50+ years. Then I go to EXACTLY your point of getting rid of people who are just learning how things are done, and replacing them with newbies (or in some rare cases, promoting them from House to Senate), and resetting the learning curve.  Then I talk about the Lobbyists and Others who are not subject to Term Limits (as well as the Revolving Door of former legislatures now lobbyists), and ask who is REALLY running the show.

5536522,"CharlieAukerman","Comment","","In the U. S., the original system of elections was developed to keep the elected officials a step away from direct control of the electorate. The Framers, using their knowledge of political ideas of the time, were not in favor of any system whereby the government was totally under the influence of the electorate. Thus, the House was the only body elected by the public at large, and although the voters were given the opportunity to vote for the President, the Electoral College effectively removed a direct election of the President.

Today's system, especially a direct election of the Senate, provides voters with a more direct voice in the election of their goverment. The Electoral College remains as a control over direct election of the President. Consequently, voters today have more of a direct say over their representatives, and thus a greater voice in their government.

The election system in the U. S. also serves to give voters greater influence, but, unlike the Parliamentary system, serves also to effectively limit the actions of the elected officials simply because the makeup of the various bodies of the government is subject to change within a given term. Unlike in the parliamentarian system, the changes need not affect the overall makeup of the government (i.e, the majority party make remain the majority party) but they can significantly narrow the margin between the two parties and thus affect actions by the government.","","",NA,"","2015-09-18 17:56:00","2015-09-18 17:56:00","False","","55e5fa6201772bc852000dac","55fc503e9714b083ce001c0d",2,0
5536522,"CharlieAukerman","Comment","","Fewer people vote in the United States for a number of reasons, some of them created by the government, and others created by the voters themselves. Among the government roadblocks to higher voter turnout are elections being held on Tuesdays rather than a more convenient time for citizens to go to the polls, voter ID laws in various states, registration laws and the number of elections, which are also staggered.

That amendment, which provided for senators to be chosen through popular vote, like congressmen since the writing of the constitution, apparently provides voters a little more direct voice in the electioneering process.  As it is now, the President is still chosen through the electoral college vote which is, though, tied to the states’ popular vote outcome.

Naturally, the United States system offers voters a better chance of influencing the election or re-election of lawmakers due to the staggered nature of the, more expensive, process.  Parties will always have to be on their toes, and will more likely propagate and defend policies that will appeal to citizens in a bid to win their, more frequent, votes.  In other words, a party’s majority is most likely to be short lived in the U.S. system than in the systems of other European democracies.  This is also a major reason for our earlier submission that a tyrannical majority with its policy push is a far less possibility in the U.S. than in their western counterparts.

For instance, a voter in Europe changing residence will only have to notify the authorities and his records will be transferred to his new place of abode to enable him vote.  In the U.S., a re-registeration is required with its attendant and varying demand on the applicant, with different states applying not same prerequisites.

This factor could easily discourage and at worst, frustrate a willing voter.  Similarly, the lower income group and less educated ones are more affected by the more stringent states’ electoral laws as it concerns registeration of voters.

Once the authority is given to regulate whether or not someone can decide to engage in commerce or not then the power is given to regulate any action, simply tie it to economics.

The example of effectively forcing States to increase the drinking age to 21 was Ronald Reagan's way of imposing his prudish morality on all Americans. Reagan linked it to highway spending and said if States don't change the law to match his moral views he would reduce highway spending to that state. Highways are pretty vital in our day and age so the threat of losing highway funds is a pretty effective way to force a State to do anything you want. I am sure that when the Republicans get back into power next time they'll use similar means to force States to ban marijuana. Personally I think its an abuse of federal power to do this. The feds should distribute highway funds fairly without these kind of conditions. After all it is the State residents who paid those federal taxes in the first place.

Her U.S. passport was in her maiden name, her wedding certificate to me was from Australia, and her driver's license, social security card, and utility bill with our new address were in her married name.  The state refused to accept our wedding certificate without the state of Queensland stamp even though the federal government had recognized it for social security and the state of Arizona recognized it for issuing a new driver's license to her.  After appealing to the state, the ruling came back a month later with the recommendation we be married in the local county, take the certificate to the driver's license bureau, and proceed with obtaining a driver's license and her voter registration.  I ended up spending two hundred dollars having an expedited copy of our marriage certificate with the Queensland stamp sent to us, but by the time we were able to resolve the matter, my wife was ineligible to vote in the 2008 presidential election.  I am of course able to access the internet, research international wedding certificates, procure the funds, afford international calling rates overseas, and take the steps necessary to jump through ridiculous hoops in order to overcome the stupidity of the state's refusal to accept a perfectly legal document honored almost everywhere else.  What chance would a poor person just seeking their birth certificate in another state have as demanded in this state?  No internet access.  Perhaps a slight name difference resulting in no record being found.  Online fees requiring credit card payment.  Some states accept a gun carrying permit but won't accept a student issued ID.  I'm sorry, photo ID laws are not just a matter of showing up and getting one issued.  I might have thought that had I not gone through what was for me a challenge, but for a poor person with no access or ability to interact freely with computer networks, it would be impossible.

So when an election comes, every citizen with the age to vote (18 years old in the case of Spain) can directly go to vote. In the US, registration is a personal decision. So the citizen has to take the step to go and get registered for vote.
Laws can make that process or registration easier or harder. Democrats made it easier with the 1993 Motor Voter Act, but republicans make it harder with the ID laws that require to have a formal ID to get registered. Those without a formal ID --a document that requires time and money to have--, which are the 10% of the US elegible citizens, are kept away from voting. That is young people, poor people and minorities, who tend to vote democratic. So the ID laws, which are been fighting in courts, benefit clearly the republicans who have found in this strategy a way to hold down voter registration.
I think to guarantee the right to vote and the principles of democracy the best way is to have an automatic system of registration so every elegible citizen is automatically registered by the Administration. This way his personal decision would one be if he decides to go to the poll station to vote or not. And the rate of participation won't depend on parties strategies and wills.

2550540,"Napoleon1958","Comment","","Federal grants-in-aid became the key instruments of the national or government expanding its power over the state governments,it became the chief instruments of the Great Society and consisted of cash payments to states and societies to the programs they administered. The medicaid program which was optional for the states, for example, required that if a state took a federal grant, then it became bound by the federal requirements for its use, and could only use it for the intended purpose and not divert it to some other usage or purpose since it was meant for low income residents.

Most of the federal grants were designated for the specific purposes and came to be known as 'categorical grants' but the Reagan Administration began to consolidate a number of such categorical grants into 'block grants' which were designated for a particular policy area, but not for a specific purpose.Such block grants were to give states and localities considerable control of how federal aid is spent. A block grant for hospitals for instance could be used to construct now hospitals in both rural and urban areas but it could also be used to buy equipment for hospitals, pay health personnel such as doctors and nurses,medical supplies like drugs, etc. 

The justification for Congress to pass laws on federal grants has been to provide the federal government in Washington,through grants and aid, to exert influence in a range of policy areas, traditionally within control of the states, including education, health and welfare. Thus this has resulted into a nationalization of the federal system. Consequently, political and economic power in America has shifted from the states,to the government in Washington.

7764093,"montsebaraza","Comment","","The original US Constitution gave little power to the people even when the first three words of the text were ""We the people"" but framers were kind of afraid of dangers of democracy so in the original text people would have a voice in the government but filtered through representative institutions. People could only vote the House of Representatives but not the Senate or the president. The members or the Senate would be chosen by the states and the president, by an Electoral College. This systems guaranteed that the federal Government would be controlled by wealthy Americans.
Things started to change with president Andrew Jackson, first, and with the Progressive Movement later. Jackson pressured th states to tie their electoral votes to the popular vote. And this is the system US has today, where people have a voice in election the House, the Senate and the president.
Later the Progressive Movement fueled the amendment to change the Senate election, since the Senate had a corruption problem. Corporations pressured state legislatures to choose senators who would protect their interests. The new amendment forced the states to adopt primary elections where the voters and not the parties chose the candidates.
These changes, still in the actual system, make the difference with the original system. They gave voice to the people to elect president, House and Senate. People's voice can be heard twice: in the primary election and in the general election.
With this system, US has more elections for national office than any other democracy.
Compared to a parliamentary system, where president, House and Senate are chosen in the same election, I think that the US system is more democratic since people have more chances to decide and influence on their representatives.They can correct president, or House policies by voting later the Senate, or correct the president by voting the House election. Plus they have more control over the legislators, since the know the individuals who represent them.
In parliamentary systems, like the one in Spain, people vote once for 4 years and vote a party who decides who goes to the House, to the Senate and who's gonna be the president. So parties inside policies have a lot of influence. I think that is a problem because this system benefits party people and it's worse for democracy.","","",NA,"","2015-09-19 10:24:00","2015-09-19 10:24:00","False","","55e5fa6201772bc852000dac","55fd37cb9714b00675000d0a",2,0

To me, the trouble is that medicine is really a new thing. At the time the constitution was written, there were several different philosophies of medicine, most of which were riddled with pseudoscience and the effectiveness of which was marginal and restricted to narrow circumstances.

Science and practice have advanced, hardly to the point of perfection, but enough that most people will go to the E.R. when they have a need for healthcare, that vaccination is routine, and that most people will see healthcare providers throughout their lives.

The system allowed only popular vote of members of the House of Representative. To the framers of the Constitution, this was to prevent what they perceived as the tyrannical rule of the majority over the minority. The system has since changed with the election of all federal officials through direct votes. Today, voters have more direct participation in electing federal officials albeit with some restrictions like the Voter ID laws.

In the U.S., the elections of legislators are different from that of the President. This provides for a situation where the voters can vote for members of legislature with a different party from that of the President. This ordinarily will create a greater checks and balances between the two tiers of government. In this case, the voters tend to have greater influence over the lawmakers.

Questions can be raised about how federal agencies differ in the administration of federal grants and whether any differences are attributed to differences in the grant programs or in the administration of the grants.

The structure of education finance, which is States and communities, as well as public and private organizations of all kinds, reflects this predominant State and local role. That is, it must establish schools and colleges, develop curricula, and determine requirements for enrollment and graduation. Yet the federal role in education is limited. Because of the Tenth Amendment, most education policy is decided at the state and local levels.

1540455,"MannionS","Comment","","Originally only members of Congress were elected by the people - Senators were appointed by State legislatures, and the President was elected by the House. That mode was meant to focus the Senators on legislation rather than on getting reelected, however it was quickly corrupted by corporate interests.  While direct election may have curbed this, over time corporate interests have figured out how to get around it again, through pouring money into campaign contributions and marketing to influence the electorate. The president is also now chosen by the people, thereby making it possible to have a president who does not have a good relationship with congress, frequently hindering either side from passing laws. 

Now, the interesting question is which way makes has more influence on enacted legislation.  If the electorate is dissatisfied with the way things are going, and in one fell swoop can elect a new government that promises to make changes, then those changes are almost certain to be made due to social pressure.  However, with the American staggering of terms, only a fraction of legislators are replaced at a time.  This can make large reforms less likely - which might be good because would prevent reactionary legislation, and yet it still means that only a fraction of the legislators are working based on their recent campaign promises or the need to get reelected. It may mean that elections have more meaningful impact since a party sweep of an election doesn't necessarily mean they get full control without any roadblocks, allowing them to double-back on campaign promises or make party-correct but otherwise alarming changes to unanticipated situations, such as war, economic crisis or epidemic disease.

1540455,"MannionS","Comment","","Voting rates are lower in the U.S. likely due to a few factors.  First and foremost is the fact that eligible voters are not automatically registered voters, as they are in Europe.  This means that people who move often, young people, and people without driver's licenses are already at a disadvantage.  Instead of automatically being able to exercise a given right, citizens have to plan their voting weeks in advance, and many may miss deadlines just because they are busy with life like most people.  Holding on to a registration requirement rather than using technology to determine the eligibility of voters and prevent them from voting in multiple districts seems like a deliberate means to make sure some people simply don't vote. 

Second is the seeming futility of voting when the vast majority of voters in the U.S. live in non-competitive districts.  Since the popular vote doesn't matter, and districts are adjusted every census to all but guarantee the outcome, many people don't feel like the act of voting for federal stations even matters. 

Finally, in my personal opinion, the two-party system and the rigid party lines that are necessarily kept to in order to maintain status in those parties has turned some people off of politics in general.  I find it hard to support certain elements of both Republican and Democratic platforms, and know that anyone I vote for will almost certainly vote for legislation that I don't agree with due to those party lines. This is a problem that has arisen from the way that elected officials get into office, rather than the federal system itself.  The history we just learned shows that every good idea can be twisted into undesirable forms.  Sweeping campaign finance and cultural reforms are needed to fix this, though both will meet with extreme resistance.

Although this original system was fraught with petitions,bribery scandals ,impasse and irregularities,the new constitution as amended in the Seventeenth Amendment allows for senators to be elected by the people through a general election rather than by the Legislature.The new system of electing federal officials also provided a platform for giving each state equal framework and aspiring individuals almost equal opportunities.Though the cost of such elections have been on the  high side ,it equally gives room for gerrymandering and redistricting of voters to give an unfair advantage to a party and its candidate as the case may be.
However,when compared to a parliamentary system,the United States system of conducting separate elections for congress,the president and House of representatives in my opinion would seem to be near ideal because the voice of the people play a significant role that cannot be treated as a pinch of salt.Secondly,it makes the representatives aware that they are they at the instance of the people whom elected them .Coming to both systems of election,when bribery and gerrymandering are put aside,the United States system affords greater influence over the lawmakers as the parliamentary system of elections could be influenced by the decision of the the monarch or president.","","",NA,"","2015-09-19 14:36:00","2015-09-19 14:36:00","False","","55e5fa8d9714b0069b000e5a","55fd72f101772b38df001c5b",2,0

Originally,the working constitution of the US did not make provisions for the right to vote by the people as can bee seen from the constitution where the people neither voted for the president or the senators.Secondly,as a result of the sustained slavery and denial of citizenship to some inhabitants before registration and after elections,a lot of eligible voters were disenfranchised.Similarly,gender discrimination against women at the time led to a lot of women who were of voting age to be denied their right to express this human right.It was not until the ratification of the 19th Amendment of 1920 that women regained the right to vote at elections throughout the country.Also,because,each state had the authority to determine its own voting criteria eligibility,a lot of people were disenfranchised in some geographical location which ordinarily would have been permitted to vote were they in another location for example.And then,the racial discrimination,literacy tests,and poll taxes,the so called ""grandfather clause"",and the 'whites-only primaries were some of the factors that greatly affected the voting rates.But,I feel that the most influencing factor was that that did not make provisions for the people to participate in directly voting of the president and the members of the senate.Over a long period of time,this would make the people lose interest in elections and voting and also make the president and senators not answerable to the people.The effect being that  the people's opinion did not matter and not even my humble self would be willing to participate (in future elections with changed/modified voting rights)if my rights to vote candidates of my choic and willing have been long subdued.

Staggered elections of Senators is a residue and it can tend to be a brake on popular government. Changing it and moving toward a general election of all Federal Officers would allow for more responsiveness. However it would in practical terms lead to a four year Senator term. The European governments that have parliamentary style elections can be difficult to manage. Who would call the election. In most of these countries it is the legislative leader that calls the election if confidence or a mandate change seems warranted. Not sure our system of a strong executive benefits from this approach. In our dual federal state system the states in a sense sometimes offer clues to where the national government may go.

7739224,"Bhoward2","Comment","","Lack of financial resources at the state level puts states at a disadvantage.  The federal government is willing to share its wealth but this generosity comes with strings attached.  Different types of grants require varying degrees of restrictions in both the distribution and expenditure of such aid.  

Great Depression era legislation and subsequent Supreme Court decisions enabled President Lyndon Johnson to create Great Society initiatives including Medicare and Medicaid, the War on Poverty, Job Corps, and Head Start.  While the states are bound by specific requirements to acceptance of federal funding for these causes, they are also free to refuse such funding and thus remain independent of federal requirements.

State acceptance of federal funding and its accompanying conditions gave rise to the term fiscal federalism, in which powers traditionally reserved for the states and localities are instead wielded in part by the federal government.   The federal government is in a position to financially assist the states, while the states and local government are in a better position to direct the aid to where it is most needed.  The need for the different levels of government to work together toward a common goal is clear, as is the ceding of power of the states in the acceptance of grants-in-aid funding.  

Legal justification for allowing Congress to determine how states use federal grant-in-aid funds comes from the expanded constitutional right of the federal government to spend money for the promotion of the general welfare of the people.

With the change of the system, voters have acquired a more direct voice in the election process than was originally, because with the originally system the constitution provisions for representative government virtually guaranteed that federal government would be controlled by wealthy, for example, the government put a lot of tricks to vote, as literacy test and property ownership.

In my personal opinion, the U.S. system of staggered and separate elections for House members, senators, and the president provides voters greater influence over lawmakers than parliamentary system where all legislators are chosen in the same election, as Colombian system, because reduce the likelihood that a majority absolute control the government, thus if a presidency of some party won the lection and also their party won the legislative election obtain a majority in congress, the part would have governing power.

I am personally exhausted over the endless campaigning that seems to have been taking place for the better part of a decade. That said, I do not currently know of a system that I would rather be subject to. 

There have been many interesting comments here about voting and many Americans not exercising their right to vote and about the voter registration/id laws. This is 2015 and I think that it is absurd that these issues cannot be easily resolved. ID is now required for nearly everything we do in the United States and I do not see a reason why voting should be any different.

First of all, really, who are the Americans that do not have some kind of government issued ID’s? In my opinion, I feel that a voter registration card with an image should be mandatory for voting. Should we make it even easier for people to obtain what they need to vote, YES, but, if someone does not have an ID of some kind in this day and age, I would wonder if they are on the lamb or here illegally. Sorry. 

Of the population who has no ID, do they collect social security or welfare, go to the bank, drive, visit a grocery or hospital, go to school or work, use a bus, a train or airport? If someone is interested in voting, and I believe all people should be, they should make the effort to get the requirements needed to vote or stop complaining. I believe this should be the same for all States. It is not an impossible task and this is quite easy for most people, especially in urban populations. I feel that having proper ID to be required to vote is just common sense and the argument that people are disenfranchised because of race or economic stature is a tired one and if this is true, all the more reason for them to vote and have their say. Let us help them do that.

Additionally, I find it embarrassing that only 60% of Americans vote, but I am not shocked that this is the case. I have heard people say they feel their vote is not going to change anything. That kind of apathy is part of the problem here. I remember in 2008 asking people why they were voting for Obama and I asked a lot of people whom I knew were, and I promise you, not one could give me one valid reason. They had no idea at all what his views were when I asked them of what they thought his stance was on key issues. The most pathetic answers to questions I asked was when I asked to differentiate the parties, “what makes someone a Democrat, Republican or Libertarian?” CLUELESS, and these people were university graduates (something I am not). It’s sad. Many of our university graduates do not even know where Cambodia is on a map, think people Miley Cyrus is the voice of their generation, and certainly have no idea how and why U.S. policy has an impact on the rest of the world. Irresponsible voting is an issue and one that I think the framers considered. Sadly, too many people really just do not care and are happy to leave it up to others to decide.

Any system of government that truly wants participation by voters will find ways to make it easier, rather than harder.

7739224,"Bhoward2","Comment","","The government argued that it had justification to compel those who were able to purchase health insurance to do so, as a way of lessening the burden on the population that was willingly participating.  The government had a second argument in that an individual mandate was necessary to protect health insurers, who would need the participation of healthy people to balance the risk pool and ensure insurers economic viability.  The government contended that under the Commerce Clause, the mandate represented legitimate interstate commerce.

Chief Justice Roberts felt that the Commerce Clause was not meant to be that broad.  The clause is meant to regulate economic activity and not economic inactivity such as not purchasing a product. Chief Justice Roberts was opposed to the idea of a mandate based on predictions of future behavior.  Chief Justice Roberts also rejected the application of the Necessary and Proper Clause, finding that the mandate would in effect be an expansion on Congress’s power rather than an aid in the exercise of its other powers.  Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Alito went a step further and would have declared the individual mandate unconstitutional.

The individual mandate then was doomed in the context of the Commerce Clause.  It was given surprising new life under the constitution’s tax and spend provisions.  The government argued that the penalty for failure to purchase health insurance was a legitimate use of its constitutional power to tax.  Chief Justice Roberts was in agreement with this and held that not having insurance constituted a taxable event.  That the legislation called it a penalty is irrelevant, substantively it is a tax; people who did not file tax returns would not pay it and it is treated in the same way as a tax.  

I have always been in favor of health reform and so my judgement is no doubt biased.  I tend to side with the government that the individual mandate should have been upheld under the Commerce Clause.  The health insurance industry in this country is massive and I contend there is nobody alive who will not at some point partake in it.  This is how I justify the broadening of the Commerce Clause to regulate non-activity of this size.  

I agree that the penalty under the tax and spend provisions is a tax and should be under that umbrella, for the reasons stated above.  

I didn’t get into the Medicaid issue but I was personally disappointed that the states were left to their own devices.  I understand the argument that it would be unconstitutional to withdraw funding that states are currently receiving and I will grudgingly agree with that.  The end result of that decision (hundreds of thousands of people still unable to access health care in their states) makes me wonder if there might have been some compromise possible.  Then I remember that Congress is free to address... oh wait.  That just depresses me.

Ostensibly our current system allows for people to elect an official that best represents their positions, however, with gerrymandering, voter-ID laws, and the Electoral College, it really doesn’t allow for all constituents to be represented. 
With staggered and separate elections in our government, it allows for the continuation of successful legislation whilst allowing for new officials to, hopefully, end unsuccessful legislation. For example, if congress passed a law that was successful but then in 2, 4, or 6 years an entirely new congress was elected that overturned the law, it would be so hard to implement anything or move forward because every so-many years the law would change, regardless of its popularity among voters. I think having staggered elections is beneficial to voters because it allows a much greater turn-over for elected officials that the people don’t think fulfilled their duty of representation.

5625574,"Kelly525","Comment","","I agree with much of what you said here, especially about the time to vote. Apathy is also a huge factor to why many do not vote and that one bothers me the most.

However, I do not agree with disenfranchisement due to Voter ID laws. This is a tired debate in my opinion. You need an ID for practically everything, banking, driving, school, work, government assistance, travel, etc.  If someone does not have an ID, I have to wonder why and I do not believe much of the ""too poor, too far"" complaints. I believe this would be a very small percentage of the population.

While there is no law that requires a citizen to have one, it is now almost impossible to do about your day without an ID. According to [Wiki's Demographics for the U.S.,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States) 81% of people in the U.S. live in an urban environment, all minorities combined make up about 36% of the total population (mostly in urban areas) and currently, about 3.5% of our population is comprised of illegal immigrants. Adding to that, the census says that 23.1% of Americans are receiving some form of government aid. [Census](http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/publications/tables/hsehld-char.html#2012). These statistics tell me that voting and acquiring ID's should be fairly simple for most people and necessary to ensure validity of votes. If you collect aid legally, if you drive legally, if you work legally, if use a bank, etc, you have to have some form of ID. 

As far as accessibility, there are certainly issues to be resolved, especially for rural populations. I feel there are many things that can be done to ease this issue, like mobile voting booths on a swanky bus or having polling venues in places like hospitals, grocery stores, nursing homes and other easily accessed places. Call on friends, family and neighbors to help people vote having a hard time getting around. Additionally, absentee voting and early voting should be allowed for all States as the postal service does have the ability to get just about anyone a ballot. Maybe the solution lies in there somewhere. ","","",NA,"","2015-09-19 20:12:00","2015-09-19 20:27:00","False","55f86d279714b083ce0018ea","55e5fb8701772be57d000de0","55fdc1cb01772bf4e4001d8b",3,0

In contrast to the American system of elections, it is difficult to say if they German people have a more direct voice in the election of their Parliament than do the Americans. It is especially difficult because the the American has one house, whereas Germany has one (the Bundesrat is not the real Parliament, i.e. the Bundestag is equivalent to Congress). The American people have more of direct voice in elections, but not more of a say in the political affairs. Considering how the question regards the former, not the latter, I'll talk about that.

7981002,"Nikollaj","Comment","","Both the formal structure and the informal traditions of American politics provide fertile ground for interest groups. One feature of the American system that enhances their influence is the relative weakness of U.S. political parties, which stems, in part, from the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches. In a parliamentary system such as Great Britain, where the prime minister's hold on office depends on majority support in Parliament, parties exert considerable control over legislators and, as a consequence, over policy making. In contrast, elections of the U.S. president and Congress are politically separate events, even when held at the same time. Each legislator must construct a winning coalition in his or her state or district, and the nature of these coalitions is quite different from the majority coalition that the successful presidential candidate assembles. Clear evidence for this is the fact that Congress and the presidency have been in the control of opposing parties most of the time since World War II. As a consequence, neither Democrats nor Republicans are invariably bound to support the positions of their party's president or their party's electoral platform. Weak party loyalty enhances interest-group influence, both during elections, when their financial support can be critical, and afterwards, when groups that supported the winning candidate become closely involved in policy making.

A second feature of the system that encourages interest groups is the decentralization of political power to states and localities, known as the federal system, or ""federalism."" Citizen associations often get started at the state and local levels, later combining into national organizations. Decentralization thus encourages a greater variety of interest groups. It also further weakens the party system, because the social and economic diversity of the 50 states make strict party discipline difficult","","",NA,"","2015-09-19 20:51:00","2015-09-19 20:51:00","False","","55e5fa6201772bc852000dac","55fdcad401772bc651001e6e",2,0

oting law opponents contend these laws disproportionately affect elderly, minority and low-income groups that tend to vote Democratic. Obtaining photo ID can be costly and burdensome, with even free state ID requiring documents like a birth certificate that can cost up to $25 in some places. According to a study from NYU's Brennan Center, 11 percent of voting-age citizens lack necessary photo ID while many people in rural areas have trouble accessing ID offices. During closing arguments in a recent case over Texas's voter ID law, a lawyer for the state brushed aside these obstacles as the ""reality to life of choosing to live in that part of Texas.""

Attorney General Eric Holder and others have compared the laws to a poll tax, in which Southern states during the Jim Crow era imposed voting fees, which discouraged blacks, and even some poor whites -- until the passage of grandfather clauses -- from voting.

Given the sometimes costly steps required to obtain needed documents today, legal scholars argue that photo ID laws create a new ""financial barrier to the ballot box.""","","",NA,"","2015-09-19 21:13:00","2015-09-19 21:13:00","False","","55e5fb5c9714b07ea7000db4","55fdcfeb9714b04b61001dcf",2,0

How to Register to Vote?

The National Mail Voter Registration Form is the one document that allows you to register to vote in most states in the U.S. North Dakota, Wyoming, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands do not accept the National Mail Voter Registration Form. New Hampshire accepts it only as a request for an absentee voter mail-in registration form. If you live in one of these states, please check with your state election office to find out how to register to vote.

You may be able to apply to register to vote in person at the following public facilities:

1. State or local voter registration and/or election offices
2. The department of motor vehicles
3. Public assistance agencies
4. Armed services recruitment centers
5. State-funded programs that serve people with disabilities
6. Any public facility that a state has designated as a voter registration agency

In twenty states, you can register online to vote. Please see the table of states with online voter registration or contact your state election office to learn more.

If you are outside of the U.S., you can get information online from the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP) or call an international FVAP hotline.

Voters today can ""directly"" vote for officials, though with gerrymandering and Voter ID laws, the word directly is overstated. I believe the current staggered system has both positives and negatives. One big positive is that change can happen more quickly. If we think the House or Senate are not doing their job, then we can change our representatives. Though, it makes the system more complicated and voter turn out is usually highest during a presidential election year. I think a parliamentary system gives voters greater influence, not because of the way our representatives are elected, but the fact that it allows for more than a two party system, which in essence creates a more representative democracy.

7906196,"RaphaelFla","Comment","","It is difficult to comprehend how electing federal officials used to operate just 200 hundred years ago, when our country was a young democracy. Only white men with property could vote, which made those elections invalid under today’s standards. It took another 100 years to allow Black Americans to vote, and then another 50 years to give the opportunity to cast a vote to women. Moreover, early on only states were able to choose members of Congress. Further reforms of our laws created the system from today, where all citizens can vote, and have a voice in electing the Congress, Senate, and the President.

There is no perfect political system in the world, still, in the US we have the opportunity to take part in creating better government every 2 years. It is enough time to get the job done, and enough time to change leaders when something goes wrong. It is also sad that not everyone appreciates the right to vote, and turn out during elections is steadily very low in comparison with other democracies.  

We may take it for granted today’s voting rights. However, we should always remember what it took to give those rights to all of us.

In Europe, the government takes the initiative in registering the voter, and in the USA, the citizen must complete additional steps and then possibly have to prove their identity when voting in person, creating the equivalent of a poll tax when a state ID is required.

Voter ID laws primarily hurt those who are black, hispanic, elderly, young, and/or poor. Poor people are less likely to be able to pay for a government-issued ID and the elderly are less likely to have a driver's license.

Most people do register to vote, however, some may not have required documents like for example Identification Card or Driving License. Someone who is on fixed income may have a hard time to find transportation to the next DMV location, which may be few hundred miles away. US is a big country in comparison with countries in Europe, where every office is close to the residence.

This lesson was recently reiterated when those states opposed to the ACA refused the Federal funds intended to assist their Medicaid programs.  And, since many of those states were very poor to begin with, their citizens must be doing some serous questioning as to just what rationale for 'States Rights' is still cogent.","","",NA,"","2015-09-20 03:04:00","2015-09-20 03:04:00","False","","55e5fbf89714b09e52000df6","55fe222a01772bc852001c7c",2,0

It absolutely is a matter of commerce because our individual health affects other people, the economy, and the incomes of health care professionals. I may have a choice in whether or not I buy a car, but I do not get to choose whether or not I will eventually get sick. That is just a human reality. If someone is uninsured, they are an economic liability to hospitals that are required by law to treat them in emergency situations even if they cannot pay. Therefore, I would have ruled that the ACA is constitutional.

As even Medicare is contracted out to Private Insurance funds.

And since the State does not have the power to force the Public to purchase one or another commodity or service--even in a monopolistic market like banking--the Commerce clause was a non-starter.  But with its ever-ready power to levy taxes, the individual mandate (unlike the Public Mandate) was a perfect fit for a 'liberal' new tax.

I would certainly have preferred to remain in France, where at its most insane, the healthcare system is still very unintrusive.  But considering the heroic lengths to which President Obama has had to go to reconcile his Social rationality with the criminal insanity of a thoroughly Privatized (Every service from soup to nuts is now a Private Business) American Society, I would say that the finessing of the ACA through the Supreme Court not once, but twice, would be something I'd not think to criticize.

In the United States voting is the individual’s responsibility. 

The United States over the years have states, who have the authority to determine voting eligibility, that pass laws restricting the rights of certain groups of people making it harder for them to register to vote or even have the right to vote. From the early years where women and slaves had no voting rights to restrictions on the black community all the way into the 1960’s we see examples. Even today we have voter I.D. laws which restrict groups like the elderly, out of state students and the black community from being able to sign up to vote. Gerrymandering and restricting early voting days and hours are two things that have happened in my area in recent years to restrict liberal voters from voting. As you can see minorities, who are more apt to be in the lower income bracket and vote Democrat, are the groups they target most often.

The senate was chosen by state legislators and the president was decided on by a system of electors. Senators are now directly chosen by the people. The President is still chosen by an electoral college, but the electors pledge to vote for whoever wins the popular vote in the state. In order to guard against majority tyranny, terms of office were staggered. House members would be elected every two years, the president every four and the senate every six. This would make it hard for an unreasoning majority to take full power in a single election.
The US system is very different to a parliamentary system, which is a more direct form of majority rule. Elected officials are all elected at the same time for the same term in office. The prime minister, chosen by the majority party, is therefore made head of legislature. In the US, it is hard to get majority rule. The legislative and executive branches are elected separately, and have different terms of office. It is often the case that power is split between parties. Arguably, this can lead to a weak system.

As a result, it is easier for people to find the time to get to the polls. In the US, elections are held during the week, making it more inconvenient for people to vote. Another reason for the difference is voter registration. Among registered voters only, voting rates in the US are roughly equivalent to those in Europe. Overall voting rate is lower because the US has a high percentage of unregistered voters, who are not allowed to vote. Also, in most European nations, the government is directly responsible for registration. This has led to the fact that 90% of those eligible to vote in Europe are registered. In the US, it is the responsibility of people to register and this is not always easy to do. In some rural places, it means travelling for a long period of time on a work day and being able to show proof of citizenship. As a result, only 75% of eligible Americans are registered to vote. The poor are disadvantaged by the system. They are less likely to have a driver's license or birth certificate available to show proof of citizenship.

control over the amount and predictability of budgetary
expenditures for grant programs by making them either
mandatory or discretionary programs and by making
their funding either open-ended or limited for a given
period (such as within a single fiscal year). Spending for
some mandatory grant programs is open-ended; that is,
the relevant agency has unlimited authority to disburse
funds as required by the conditions set forth in authorizing
legislation.
 Medicaid, for example, falls into that
category. Spending on other mandatory grant programs,
such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
(TANF), may be limited to amounts specified in the
authorizing law for a given program. Discretionary grant
programs are also limited because they are funded
through annual appropriation acts, which set out the
maximum amounts that the federal government can
commit to spend in a fiscal year for those grants.
Grants to state and local governments can promote
economic efficiency in instances when those governments
have localized knowledge that would permit them to
implement a program more efficiently and effectively
than the federal government could but when they have
insufficient incentives or funding to provide a good or
service—infrastructure, for example—whose benefits
extend beyond their jurisdictions. In addition, some
grants use the broad federal tax base to redistribute
resources among communities and individuals, and
certain intergovernmental grants can help stabilize the
economy. In some cases, federal policymakers turn to
intergovernmental grants to encourage state and local
governments to adopt federal policy priorities. Finally,
such grants may help foster policy experimentation at the
state and local levels that would be difficult to achieve in
a single national program.","","",NA,"","2015-09-20 12:03:00","2015-09-20 12:03:00","False","","55e5fbf89714b09e52000df6","55fea08b01772bc852001cb3",2,0

In a European, Parliamentary system where everyone is elected at one general election interest might be somewhat higher every 5 or 6 years (however frequently the Government is elected).  You elect everyone at one poll and you are done.  With elections for Representatives in America every 2 years and Senators every 6 we certainly have Presidential Election years every 4 years that should be of great interest and I believe the numbers show that these years usually have high voter turnout.  But if you live in a ""stacked"" congressional district where the opposition party has little or no chance of winning the seat, then voters may be apathetic in off year elections.  Simply put there is no interest.  

I have lived in a gerrymandered Congressional district all my life and it is safe to say that no one of the opposition party has ever represented me in Congress.  I am not suggesting this is good or bad.  People who need access to politicians know how they are treated on an individual basis.  So everyone has a different experience and understanding here.  So far as I can recall the congressmen who have represented me are very ""plain vanilla"" sorts with little or no reason to lose an election.  They do their job, get money for the district and have a good voting record.  These are good working class political values and you can keep your safe district with them, but it may not generate voter turnout.

Construing the Commerce Clause to permit Congress to regulate individuals precisely because they are doing nothing would open a new and potentially vast domain to congressional authority. Congress already possesses expansive power to regulate what people do.
Upholding the Affordable Care Act under the Commerce Clause would give Congress the same license to regulate what people do not do.
The Affordable Care Act describes the “[s]hared responsibility payment” as a “penalty,” not a “tax.” That label is fatal to the application of the Anti-Injunction Act. It does not, however, control whether an exaction is within Congress’s power to tax.
The Spending Clause grants Congress the power “to pay the Debts and provide for the  general  Welfare of the United States.

Even the literacy tests played an important role because ""everyone"" could apply to it but few black people did it, and even when they did it, if they passed it, they were told they failed. The process to have today's system took years but it is completely sure that the original system and today's system differ in many things.

Now, regarding the system of staggered and separate elections and a system, it has its pros and cons. It helps to isolate politicans from a tyrannical majority, but it gives less influence to the voter over lawmakers. However, it protects the minority.

7875551,"NicUK","Comment","","Why are voting rates in the United States lower than in Europe? Which demographic groups are most disadvantaged by U.S. voting laws? Why?

In the US voters are not automatically registered.  They have individual registration with an emphasis on the voter to register in the first instance.  Automatic registration of voters in a number of Europoean countires and constant updating of records e.g. through moving house etc. helps to build higher levels of participation.

A range of tactics in the US, dependent on individual state influences and partisan politics can make it additionally difficult for certain groups people to register to vote e.g. young people who may not have identification documents such as a driving licence, immigrants who are not able to apply for required documentation allowing them to register.

Gerrymandering in US states means potentially greater numbers of voters potentially being disengaged and therefore not voting.  Why bother to vote if your opponent already has it 'sewn up'. It is a feeling of a 'wasted' vote.

However, the states would need to either reduce proportionately whatever program is funded, or raise taxes to pay for it.  There is an irony in the federal government's distribution of dollars to the states.  In general, the states that pay the lease in taxes per capita receive the greatest amount of federal dollars per capita.  In general, these states are Republican, and their senators often demand the size of the federal government be reduced passionately knowing full well they benefit disproportionately.  

For a state to turn down Medicaid funding under the ACA might have seemed heroic to some, but to me, it punished the poor uninsured in the lower income brackets and it reflected the state's ability to punish its own citizenry over political ideology.  The choice was not about fiscal responsibility, nor reducing federal costs, nor burdening the states with future expense.  The cost to the public for hospitalization and medical costs for those uninsured who receive treatment is passed through in higher insurance costs for those insured.  Again, on the surface it seems a fiscal choice, but in the end, it just costs individuals more.

2038150,"JerryHa","Comment","","We must carry auto insurance if we drive.  It is not legal to drive without it.  We are not insured because of social concern for the driver, but for the costs of an accident and the liability being financially assigned to a party that would have the resources.  I for one think this is a good idea even though it is state by state regulation I believe.

The ACA would be similar if it outlawed health care to people without insurance.  Fine, go uninsured, but don't show up at a hospital begging for help at my expense.  You had insurance available at a greatly subsidized rate through my tax dollars and you failed to obtain it.  You can't drive without a insurance, you shouldn't be given free health care if everyone else needs to pay.  Obviously this sounds harsh.  I would prefer higher taxes and a national medicare program for all, but that's not the solution implemented.  

Establishing a requirement for all citizens to carry insurance or pay a penalty might seem oppressive and an over reach of the federal government.  The arguments on both sides have legitimacy if I remove emotions about health care itself.  However, I am taxed on my income by the federal government, and not at the same rate as someone who makes lesser income.  The ""penalty"" for failing to obtain health insurance is administered by the IRS, which directly links it to taxes, and the federal government has the right to levy taxes.  The fact it is applied to those without insurance is no different than applying a different rate to those who don't sell hedge funds in my opinion.

One major point to validate voters' direct voice is the Andrew Jackson's reform which attributes popular votes to electoral votes, hence ensuring that the majority voice carries the day. However, since this is adhered to states with higher population having more electoral votes, we can see a limitation in the case where a candidate for Presidential election may have the overall popular vote but still lose the presidency due to the fact that his/her opponent won in bigger states. If I'm not wrong, this should be the case of George W Bush and President Clinton's vice President in the 2000 elections.
However, to this system is more direct that the Parliamentary system of election. Here I think the people might miss out on who has the better quality and capacity to lead the nation, since the party with more representatives get to vote their leader as Prime Minister, hence Head of State. Thus the voters' play and indirect role. Further more, we might have a very good leader for the nation but due to the fact that the party lost many representative seats, he/she loses the job.

First of all, nowadays people have more access and a direct way of voting for Senate, House and President. During the original system they could only vote for the House. This makes an important change due to the fact that citizens have the right to choose the entire Congress and the President. Because of this, americans acquired a more direct voice although they have a lot of 'filters' for the voting process. For instance, the figure of the Electoral College does not exist in Colombia, we vote directly for the correspondent elections of our city or town and also for Senators and House Representatives, no matter where we're from.

The US system of staggered and separate elections is completely different to the parliamentary system, but I think that the latter is more democratic. In a parliamentary system the whole Congress and Presidency are changed, which makes it difficult for the next administration to pursue and continue the projects and initiatives that the previous had completed. This is of course an obstacle and weakens the electoral system because people do not vote regularly.

a. Registration Process: In the US, if you want to vote, you have to register. This makes an important difference from european countries, in which the state does the job for you. What does this imply? That certain people are left behind from the voting process if they do not register on time. It also implies that people who do not have political culture will not do the process because they're not interested (or think it is not important). For example, in Colombia we have the same system as in Europe. Although our political culture is not good, there are certain governmental campaigns to promote electoral activism, reminding people that they're registered and they only have to 'go to the voting place and vote'.

b. Understanding of the Model: Some people in the US do not understand how their country works, which becomes an obstacle, because they think that local elections are not as important as presidential, and they do not see that they're highly linked. In Europe works the other way around. They emphasize on educational programs that teach people how to vote, when to do it, and why doing it.

Obviously, the biggest advantage of the US system is the protection of the minority rights over the control of the majority, even if we have seen that this advantage have been some times theorical over american history. In a british or canadien parlementary system, democratie is more efficient in the sense that executive and legislative powers work systematicaly together and the will of the majority is reflected in legislation more effectively. In Canada, minority righs are protect by charters of rights, so the check and balance is exercised mostly by the judiciary system.

The staggered system reduces the chances of one political party from gaining control of both houses and the presidency. It also requires the bodies of government to work/compromise with one another in order to govern effectively. However, this also can result in lack of cooperation and the stalling of government. When all of the officials are voted in the same election the system can be controlled by the majority class, which would implement the laws that favored them.","","",NA,"","2015-09-21 02:57:00","2015-09-21 02:57:00","False","","55e5fab49714b0b433000de8","55ff72369714b08e06001ec6",2,0

6980709,"swc090","Comment","","A grant-in-aid is given by the federal government, as a transfer of money, to a state government, local government or an individual with the intention of the money being used to fund a specific project or program. States are free to reject such proposals but accepting a grant commits their participation to use the money for its original purpose. 

The Great Depression in the 1930s caused many Americans to be financially insecure and greatly required government assistance, whether it was local or federal. Roosevelt's implementation of the New Deal programs was an example of grants-in-aid in action and how it had contributed in expanding federal authority relative to the states' authorities. Although the Supreme Court justices at the time viewed the grant-in-aids as an undermining of free market principles and a foreshadowing of government regulation gone amok, FDR's landslide 1936 re-election was evident that Americans supported the New Deal, despite the 5-4 ruling. After Roosevelt suggested to increase the number of justices in the Supreme Court, Owen Roberts switched sides and the grants-in-aid were ruled constitutional. This was significant because it showed that an overwhelming public support managed to not only have a direct influence but to also have caused a decisive action to make federal authority the law of the land: the people's ruling superseded the Supreme Court's.

Maybe this shows that grants-in-aid historically have been populist policies and is, to an extent, a true reflection of what the people want as opposed to what the constitution permits.

The most significant was the Roosevelt’s New Deal. On one hand, conservatives were against such an intrusion in people’s life, on the other hand they realized, that without the help of federal government, the economy will only slowly improve, and states do not have the needed funds to help people in this dire situation. 
The struggle to keep small government or increase government’s power continues today. It was interesting that President Clinton was the one who cut federal spending for low income people, surprising his own Democrat Party. His goal was to bring more people into labor force. The plan worked, and the economy boomed. 
Today, it is interesting to see how marijuana legalization in some states challenged the relationship between federal law, which still makes marijuana illegal, and states law which legalized it. Well, there is no federal help in selling marijuana needed but it looks like the states took the gamble, and make it possible to spread marijuana use in Oregon , Colorado etc. 
In theory, the federal government could close all the marijuana dispensaries even today, however, federal government announced that there will be no action from the side of government against marijuana legalization. 

Federal grants for Obama’s Care were rejected by some states, where Medicaid Expansion met with some opposition from more conservative  states. I think that this ideology warfare is only hurting people in need, who are living in the Deep South. Unfortunately, Southern states are not only conservative, but also full of poor people who need most of the help.

I can only imagine what was going on during hearing and debating on this issue of Affordable Care. Court Judges knew exactly how important their decision is, still they also knew that they cannot decide this or other cases based on emotions. They have to base every decision on one very important document: Constitution of the United States of America.

Indeed, “U.S. Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the various states”. 

Until today, the very first sentence of Justice Roberts resonates under many Constitutional Law scholars: “The Affordable Care Act is constitutional in part and unconstitutional in part. The individual mandate cannot be upheld as an exercise of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause”.
It was one of the most confusing opinions, when we later learned that the Affordable Health Care was upheld. Additionally, another issue where the penalty was finally called “ a tax”, was difficult for judges to agree. 
In the end, the reform passed and I would make similar decision.

622743,"SunShineStateGirl","Comment","","I find a lot of these conclusions are subjective, whether or not a voter has direct influence depends on how you define ""direct influence""  Our current system that opens voting to all citizens age 18 and over certainly gives more people an opportunity to participate.  But, aside from the occasional Mr. Smith going to Washington, I don't find elected official care at all about their constituents opinions.  Perhaps I'm too hardened a cynic when it comes to government but most officials are primarily concerned with staying in power - as the two primary parties are primarily concerned with staying in power.  And the best way to stay in power is to appear to your constituents to be serving their interest.  So, with Senators now being elected by popular vote they are more concerned about what their constituents think.  That also sets up a problem in that a Senator is thus compelled to serve his/her state at the expense of the good of the nation as a whole; ie. the old government contract for outdated parts scenario.

I live in one of the nations top ten gerrymandered districts; I admit I feel its pointless to contact my house representative.  I do sometimes just for the record but I know its pointless.  So I definitely don't feel I have any greater access to being heard.

I think this course gives short shrift to one major reason people don't register to vote - fear of being called to jury duty.  Now that states use driver's license rolls instead of voter rolls that should help but that was a biggie to some people.

An ""all in"" election cycle would certainly give more power to the party that won but would totally diminish members of other parties.  A staggered election creates some small degree of balance which does give a greater number of people the option to be heard.

I don't think people really matter that much under either system; officials respond to who can keep them in power, whether those large funding organizations are businesses or unions.

Now, jurors come from driver's license lists (though with so many licensed drivers I don't understand why I come up so often :( 

The lecture and article also ignore that people can absentee vote and you don't need to show ID.  People with health problems or other issues can choose to absentee vote.  Some just busy or lazy people choose to do this.

This section also promotes the fallacy that lack of prosecution of voter fraud equals lack of voter fraud.  Let's see, who would be in charge of investigating and prosecuting voter fraud - oh yes, that would be the executive branch that was just elected.  Hmmm

It used to be that we had day to vote then they instituted early voting - then they wanted to change early voting from two weeks to one week - and goodness did the caterwauling begin.  You'd think they had imposed martial law - so we keep open the polls with lonely little poll workers sitting there all day to service the one or two people that come in.

I don't have a problem with voter ID laws, and honestly, since fake credentials can be obtained I'm not sure how good they are.  I feel bad if there are people that feel they can't vote - it is hard for me to understand because there are so many options; nonetheless I won't discount it as possible but the reason we've expanded to early and absentee voting is to make it an option for more people.  

I guess the group most disadvantaged by the current voting laws would be our military whose votes often aren't counted because their packets are sent too late for them to participate.  If I were a cynic I would think that had something to do with them being likely to vote conservative.

8020587,"GrasonHumphrey","Comment","","Federal grants-in-aid have played a significant role in expanding federal authority because if states choose to accept the sometimes significant grants, Congress has control over how those funds may be used.  This effectively gives Congress control over some portion of the state accepting the grant, but the state has freely given up it's right to control that portion by accepting the grant.

The justification for allowing Congress to determine how states may use federal grants-in-aid is that grants-in-aid are a privelege or gift, not a right of the states.  This allows Congress to set conditions on how their ""gift"" to the states may be used.  This still allows a separation between state and national government because states do not have to accept federal grants-in-aid and surrender some of their powers.","","",NA,"","2015-09-21 14:05:00","2015-09-21 14:05:00","False","","55e5fbf89714b09e52000df6","56000ea49714b06f3d001dff",2,0
8020587,"GrasonHumphrey","Comment","","In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius(2012), the pro-argument regarding the taxing clause was that Congress has the authority to tax according to the taxing clause, and the fine on people without health insurance was a tax.  The con-argument regarding the taxing clause was that the fine on people without health insurance was not a tax and was really just a penalty inflicted by Congress on those without insurance, which would be unconstitutional.  The pro-argument regarding the commerce clause was that Congress has the authority to control commerce and could use that authority to compel people to own health insurance.  The con-argument regarding the commerce clause was that Congress only has the authority to punish or control action, not inaction of citizens.  Congress was forcing people to take action and buy insurance they didn't want and punishing people for the inaction of not buying insurance.

I would have reached a decision on the con-side for both clauses and ruled that Congress does not have the power to impose an individual insurance mandate.  For the taxing clause, it seems like a large stretch of the imagination to say that the fine on people without health insurance is really a tax.  For the commerce clause, I would say that Congress was forcing people to take the action of buying insurance or punishing them for not buying insurance, which would be unconstitutional.","","",NA,"","2015-09-21 14:19:00","2015-09-21 14:19:00","False","","55e5fc969714b01c9d000e1f","560011fe9714b08e06001f2c",2,0

It could be seen that way, that it bypasses the states' power. However, states do not complain when they receive the money because they need it to offer and provide those services. Otherwise, those become unaffordable. Nevertheless, when it comes to say who is offering the service, the state government does not say that it is paying it through a grant of the federal government, it just takes the credit. So, I don't think the federal government is just trying to bypass the states' government. I think the states want too much power and be above the national government and being like that is not being a nation. 

The 21-years-old drinking age policy is a good example. The president was just saying that too many kids were having too many accidents just for being irresponsibles. The only way the states could accept that policy was through the grants for the highways.

However the Supreme Court did rule in favor of Congress to impose a penalty by declaring that the penalty for not purchasing health insurance was a tax, which is within the power of Congress. Opponents believed that when the law was advertised to the general public, this tax was called a penalty in order to avoid the negative connotation of the government imposing another tax; therefore Congress does not have the power to impose such a penalty.
I would have ruled in favor of the states in both decisions.

8155243,"danielafonseca","Comment","","PAST SYSTEM FOR ELECTING FEDERAL OFFICIALS: It was a system that wasn’t a real democratic system, first at all the population didn't have a real right to vote for the candidates they wanted. It was a system designed to favor some specific and strong groups (whites and rich), nevertheless with the pass of the time, this system suffered some modifications getting a more democratic shape. Especially since the constitution started to guarantee the minorities’ rights.

TODAY’S SYSTEM: The System that is today used to elect the president, and the lawmakers (senate and House of Representatives) is much more a democratic system, through this system it is possible to talk of a real equal opportunity to participate on the federals official’s elections. By this system all the states are guaranteed to have a reasonable representation and a fare influence at the time to make the laws or the government the country. In case to elect the president, s/he will be elected by direct vote, each one of the citizens have the right of one vote. And in the election of the lawmakers, the vote is also direct. 
The congress is divided in two parts:

-	Senate: Each state of the country have 2 seats doesn’t matter the size of population. It guarantee that the small states are not going to be oppressed by the bigger, in terms that all of them have exactly the same number of votes in this camera
-	House of Representatives: Its seats al elected proportioned to the each state’s population, in this way those states that al bigger will have a bigger number of seats than those states that are smaller. 

IN THIS WAY TERMS WE CAN AFFIRM THAT THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM HAS CHANGED TO GIVE A REAL DIRECT PARTICIPATION TO THE CITIZENS IN THE USA.




THE U.S. SYSTEM OF STAGGERED AND SEPARATE ELECTIONS: This system let the voters to elect the president and the congressmen directly and in different dates, in that way there is the possibility that the majority in each one could be of different parties guarantying the democracy. If there is diversity in the congress the diversity will be protected, avoiding the tyranny.   

THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM: In this system the Primer minister is not directly elected by the population, s/he is chosen by the parliament and s/he’ll be the leader of two branches (executive and legislative) this is in some way a fusion of powers going against the separate of branches principle. Due that the Primer minister is chosen by the parliament, it is almost secure that this person is going to work for the majorities interests, putting in dangerous the rights of the minorities.

In those terms the US system provides greater influence over lawmakers.

Federal grants in-aid, money plays a key role in the federal government's relationship with the states. congress gives money to the states, for example, but stipulates how this money should be used in order to force the state to cooperate with federal policies.
in 1972, the Nixon Administration initiated a practice called revenue sharing, in which the federal government gave money to the states with no restrictions attached whatsoever. Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter relied less on revenue sharing, which disappeared completely in the 1980s during the Reagan Administration. for example, horizontal federalism, state government relate to one another States often compete or cooperate on many different issues, from environmental policy economic development. one stat, for example, may lower its tax rate in order to attract businesses away from other state. states have a great deal of leeway in how they behave toward one another.

In contrast in Europe, if a person changes s/he address the postal office has the obligation to inform this situation to the election officials to keep upload the system. 
That’s why Europe has approximately 90% of its voters registered compared with the about of 75% America has.
Regarding which group is more affected for this situation in America I’d say the democrats, due that not all the people is able to get registered for one or other reason, it is usually easier to people with a bigger income to do it than to the poor people. As a result of this the Republican Party gets and advantage over the Democratic Party, due to that usually the richer people are Republicans and the people with a lower income tent to belong to the Democratic Party.

7961591,"GalustKhudaverdyan","Comment","","The main reason is voter registration. In the US, voter registration - it is the responsibility of the voter, so part of the lost votes.
It is also due to the abundance of elections at different levels. The selection can be so much that the ordinary citizen becomes interesting to study each candidate: listen to his speeches, read his propaganda material, etc. Therefore ordinary American can choose for themselves, for example, the election only a certain level - president, congressman, member of the city council, etc. Sometimes the ordinary American is important to choose a member of the city council in the city than to choose the country's president. Because ordinary voter may never see their president, and the person elected to the City Council can be found repeatedly.
But it is worth noting that the specifics of the election and turnout is different in different countries. For example, in Russia in local elections the turnout may be high due to fraud. 50-80% of the ballots could be falsified, ie, the voices of real voters may mean nothing, because 50-80% of the votes will go to a specific party (the ruling) and its candidates. To achieve fair elections on 1 (only one) polling station must be 3-4 independent and legally trained observer. And in such sites around the country 100 000.
So it is easier to solve the problem of unregistered voters in the United States than to find 300-400 thousand independent observers in Russia.","","",NA,"","2015-09-21 21:54:00","2015-09-21 21:54:00","False","","55e5fb8701772be57d000de0","56007c9d01772bdebd001d72",2,0

This has resulted in an environment where each branch of the government was forced by public pressure to seriously consider the implications, especially the legality. The fact that a program this controversial is still in operation, where there has been essentially three separate entities who could of at least attempted to curb tail it, shows that it is a legal program within our nations framework.

To beware of the tyranny of the president, congressmen and senators elected for various periods of time (2,4,6), a third of the Senate is elected every 2 years. So seize the power of the parties in a particular period is problematic, as there is rapid turnover of power. US citizens can through frequent elections, control the power.

The American system is not Parliament as a parliamentary involves the selection of members of Parliament at the same time and for one term. In a parliamentary system, voters do not have such an opportunity to control the power as in the US.

The American system is more committed in influencing voters in power, as the parties are required to maintain the loyalty of voters constantly, as every 2, 4 or 6 years, voters decide whom to choose to Congress, the White House (President) or the Senate.

Although the Constitution was originally written to be elected through the popular vote, the members of Congress but not to the senators who then were elected by state legislatures and not the president who was elected by the voters.

Then, this method was changed later when he presented a constitutional amendment in which the election of senators depends on the popular vote to date.

Also, as a preventive mechanism against possible abuse of power by federal officials, it was constitutionally established that the mandate was staggered for all levels being the president was at the helm for four years, senators for 6 and members of the House by 2 years.

Thus, I believe that the ""step command"" mode in a representative democracy is a preventive measure against future disturbances or dictatorial outlines but does not work in all current ""democracies"".

For example, in USA the division of powers focuses only on the executive and the legislature; the court is shared by the first two. In Mexico, the division of powers is the same, with the only difference that the judiciary is independent and is headed by the Supreme Court; led by 11 ministers who enjoy constitutionally mandated 15 years !!!!


In this last example we can see that the term of office for 15 years, is more prone to abuse of power ""ministers of justice"" is revealed.

What really separates the American political system from other western democracies is that the United States operates a presidential system of governance, as opposed to the European-style parliamentary system.   This system increases the chance that the legislative and executive branches will be controlled by different parties.  It also diffuses federal power to a certain extent, hence the term ""separation of powers"" 

advantages 

1. Separate government can easily lead to legislative inaction or ""gridlock"", especially when two parties hold power.

This inaction leads to two additional downsides:

2. The U.S. is occasionally less able to respond to dramatic crises or other events requiring decisive action than other nations.

3. Voters are constantly dissatisfied with Congress and the legislative process 

4. Americans have fewer viable candidates and parties to choose from, and many political ideologies.
5. When voters have only one representative, there is a chance that their congressman may not represent their political ideology.

6. Ideologically pure Americans on the far left and right are often dissatisfied with the centrist legislation that the system encourages.

8143794,"ClaudiaOvalle","Comment","","The system for electing federal officials is effectively the same today as it was when the Constitution was adopted.  What has changed however, is the size of the Union, the influence of political parties, and the emergence of ""swing states"" due to the state-by-state winner-take-all system that has been put in place.  Whereas Madison argued that as the nation increased in size, the power of factions would wane due to geographical distance, other difficulties have arisen as a result of this growth.  However, factions were replaced with institutional political parties that have taken hold and severely limited the political discourse to a diametrically-opposed model instead of various diverse groups united by common goals and interests.  In addition, due to the winner-take-all system​ of state electors, individual votes still count as much as they did back then (very little) and the votes of the electors aren't really their own votes since they are dictated to vote as a block with the other electors from their respective states.  This has created a system where in each election cycle there are a handful of states that effectively decide the election, since almost all states have been permanently painted blue or red due to gerrymandering.  In these swing states, where the election is too close to call outright, the votes actually do matter however, this creates a system where the entire election is essentially decided by voters in 3 to 5 states.



The U.S. system of staggered elections allows for more continuity in government with very little sudden change, and that was how the framers of the Constitution intended it.  They were fearful of sweeping governmental change, for fear that it could lead to tyranny or at the very least, reactionary policies instead of long-term thinking on the part of government.  In the Parliamentary model, voters may feel as if they are more directly involved in policy because when they elect a new party to power, their ascension is usually followed by sweeping changes and reforms.  This instant gratification might make voters in Parliamentary countries does create the feeling of affecting change on the parts of voters however, the limitation is that the party itself has a far more powerful and official role in these systems, thus removing a great deal of decision making power from the voters.  In the U.S. system, although change at a governmental level feels glacial there is a directness to the way we elect our national representatives.  But, since the parties are not as strong in the U.S., it is hard to predict how an official will perform once elected.","","",NA,"","2015-09-22 02:14:00","2015-09-22 02:14:00","False","","55e5fa8d9714b0069b000e5a","5600b98501772bc9ad001e36",2,0
8153248,"EduardoLHernandezCalo","Comment","","Federal grants-in-aid played a major role in the expansion of federal authority. During the Great Society Domestic Plan, launched by democrat-affiliated president Lyndon B Johnson in 1964-1965, the federal government assigned cash payments to states and localities for programs they administer. This political practice became known as fiscal federalism. For instance, Washington DC started in 1965 the Medicaid Program for those with incomes below the poverty line. Johnson’s Great Society gave more power to the federal government by also determine how states can use federal grants-in-aids. If a state takes a federal grant, it is bound by the federal requirements for its use. The money is appropriated by Congress, and Congress has the constitutional authority to stipulate how that money can be used (video lecture, 2015). However, what’s the justification for this purpose? The fact is that it’s not state’s money but Congress. They decide how the grants will be use and its purpose. For example, if states are assigned a grant for public schools they cannot discriminate against handicap or minority group students. Ultimately, states have the privilege to obtain federal grants but they have to bind to Congress stipulations in order to receive federal funds. The federal law is the Supreme Law of the Land (John Marshall in McCulloch v Maryland).

8153248,"EduardoLHernandezCalo","Comment","","During early 2010 Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), also known as Obamacare. Since then, it has been subject to continuous political scrutiny from republicans. Political adversaries stated that such federal statute will substantially increase medical insurance cost. However, democrats knew better. They decided for individual mandates, which means everyone has to enroll in an insurance in order to hold down its cost. This political practice polarized politics in the United States to the extent that a case was filled to the Supreme Court consideration. National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012) was the first of two cases filed to revoke the Affordable Care Act.  The justices on the Supreme Court were divided in their views on whether the Constitution’s taxing clause and commerce clause gave Congress the authority to impose an individual insurance mandate. We’ll see how the Supreme Court carefully handled both clause options to whether revoke or uphold the law passed by the 111th United States Congress. 

The individual mandate became the target of Republicans, after they failed to defeat the health care bill in Congress. The commerce and tax clause soon become a central topic of discussion in order to provide vast evidence for Supreme Court. The Obama administration postulated, regarding commerce clause, that the uninsured impose a cost on the nation's economy. When they become sick, they go to the emergency room, with the cost being borne by the hospital, which then passes the cost along to other patients (video lecture, 2015). Imposing a burden on the economy and therefore, it was subject to regulation by Congress. Republicans’ lawyers argued that the government cannot obligate people to engage in commerce, meaning that they have no authority to mandate a compulsory individual insurance. The Supreme Court manifested satisfaction with this last argument, however they upheld the Act. SC argued that even though Congress and the Obama administration had used the term ""a penalty"" rather than a ""tax"", to describe the payment required of individuals without health insurance, the payment is effectively a tax. Said the Court, ""It is reasonable to construe what Congress has done as increasing taxes on those who have a certain amount of income, but choose to go without health insurance. Such legislation is within Congress's power to tax.” (Supreme Court ruling on Obamacare, June 2012). 

Opinion: If I had been on the Supreme Court, I would have argued about the taxing clause and commerce clause as one complement argument. For instance, commerce and tax are two inherent aspects of any world-leading economy. By acknowledging that statement, Obamacare was constitutional since it gave power to Congress to promote commerce by enrolling beneficiaries to the Program. If they don’t, they will then receive a tax (penalty), which also promotes more income to the Federal government. But, we know this was not about increasing government arcs, which also would have helped, instead it was for a noble cause. Having every low-income citizen medical-insurance secured: A cause rooted in our social, economic and medical general welfare.

8100868,"euge12345","Comment","","The individual mandate was the key to making the program work, and it meant that was mandatory for everybody to enroll in insurance programs, not only sick people, with the objective of maintaining balanced the costs.
Although both parts in the suit alleged on the basis of the commerce clause, the Court finally upheld its decision on the ground of the tax clauses.  The Obama administration argued that the uninsured impose a cost on the nation's economy (subject to regulation by Congress) because the sick patient passes the cost along to other patients. 
In contrast, lawyers for the Republican states argued that, although Congress obviously has the power to regulate commerce, it cannot force individuals to engage in commerce because It lacks the power to regulate economic inactivity.
A majority on the Court held that even though Congress and the Obama administration had used the term ""a penalty"" rather than a ""tax"", to describe the payment required of individuals without health insurance, the payment is effectively a tax, and such legislation is within Congress's power to tax.
I think both clauses allows to reach the same result. That’s why court’s constitutional interpretation is, in the end, a political issue.

7991225,"brenky","Comment","","When America was in its infancy, the people only voted for members of the House of Representatives.  Voters' power was somewhat limited in that they did not have a say in the presidency or senate, as the framers of the constitution feared that a total democracy would diminish the rights and views of the minority.  However, this system was not perfect as greed and corruption ran rampant, with corporations and wealthy individuals influencing voting.  Contrast that with today where the American public have the right to vote for the house, senate and presidency.  This flies in the face of the framers' original vision. 

Although some of the changes were made to put a stop to corruption and bribery taking place in the voting system and make it easier for a layman to be voted into office, this does not seem to have taken much hold.  Campaign spending for the house elections have skyrocketed in recent years.  To get that money, candidates need to be well-off, well-known, and well-advised.  The average citizen just doesn't have those resources available.

When comparing the voting system of the three different branches to that of a parliamentary system in which voters choose all members at once, the American system gives voters more influence over lawmakers.

I see some danger in answering such a question before other professionals actually seek out my guidance and expertise.  

Arguments for using the Commerce Clause to allow Health Care were that if someone receives emergency room treatment and cannot pay this effectively raises health care costs for those with insurance and effects commerce.  Opponents of the Commerce Clause argument suggest that this interferes with individual decision making - something not intended - and compared this to forcing people to choose healthy foods so as to not become sick and not burden commerce.

President Obama suggested a ""penalty"" be levied on those without health insurance.  While they did not use the word ""tax"" the court ruled that it was a tax.  Opponents of this argument pointed out that President Obama did not use the word ""tax"" expressly and so this was not the government's original intent.

In the U.S. the poor and minority, are most disadvantaged by the U.S. voting laws.  Many U.S. states require identification in the form of a driver's license or passport, which many of these demographic do not possess.   Additionally, the government identification cards, another form of id, are not readily available for the poor or minority groups.

Interestingly, the Motor Voter Law unveiled by President Clinton in 1993, requires the offer of voter registration when citizens apply for their driver's license or acquire registration (could be wrong).  The question arises as to why would this matter, as the person applying would already have said identification.

The Democratic Party, who champions welfare and minimum wage rise, is the party that has most to benefit by allowing voter id to be less difficult for the poor and minority.  As wealth is proportional to voting trends, it is imperative that the ballot box is as qual as possible for every American.","","",NA,"","2015-09-22 11:21:00","2015-09-22 11:21:00","False","","55e5fb8701772be57d000de0","560139ae9714b08e06002043",2,0

I'm not sure it's meaningful to frame the question as greater or less voter influence - to me they're just very different.
In a system where everyone is elected at the same time I think it's somewhat easier for voters to be aware of their choices, and exercise their voting rights.
However, as stated in the lecture, America's system with primaries and general elections affords more opportunities to vote.
All that said, so few people exercise their right to vote that (again, as shown in the lecture) citizens in European parliamentary elections end up voting far more than Americans.
In the US I also see a big difference in local vs. state vs. federal elections.  National elections get a lot of attention but my individual influence as a voter is relatively small compared with my influence in a local election. Local elections affect me a lot (for example in housing, zoning and education) but receive less attention from voters.

In European democracies, the government takes responsibility for registering voters. If a citizen moves, the postal officials will notify the election officials to change the voter registration.  In contrast, in the United States, voter registration is the individual's responsibility. It may be an inconvenience to obtain a voter ID.

Minority groups, the poor and the young are the most disadvantaged voters. Sometimes it is difficult of obtain a voter ID because of financial constraints. Voters in rural area have trouble accessing ID offices. Lower income voters are less likely to be informed of issues. They feel their vote doesn't count and are not involved in the system.

As each type of case arose the Court deliberated as to whether the particular right was so fundamental that states needed to guarantee that right.

8054533,"DNA_Shadow","Comment","","The Constitution is the supreme law of the land in the US, but it has undergone significant changes throughout the years which have profoundly affected the ways in which federal officials are elected.  In the original Constitution, the public only voted directly for members of the House of Representatives in Congress.  Both the President and the Senate were elected indirectly.  In the case of the President, the system of the Electoral College was developed so that each state would have a number of “electors” equal to the number of representatives they held in Congress (House and Senate combined).  These electors were selected by the state legislatures, and they held the power to casts votes for the President.  In the case of the Senate, it was originally also the individual state legislature’s job to select the Senators for each state.

The reasoning behind the limited influence of the public came from the philosophy held by many of the framers of the Constitution, which was highly apprehensive about allowing for “pure democracy” since they believed it would lead to a form of tyranny where the majority trampled on the rights of the minority.  This philosophy is articulated by James Madison, who said, “Pure democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention… and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.”  Due to the wariness about giving the public too much power, the framers named the new government a “republic” rather than a democracy.  

Despite the intentions of the framers to limit the chances of a tyranny of the majority, they may have increased the chances for tyranny by the elite.  In the absence of direct public elections for Senate and Presidential positions, the federal government in the early history of the US was dominated by wealthy or prominent Americans, rather than ordinary citizens who made up the vast majority of the population.  As a system of representative government, this was questionable, and it was ultimately challenged and altered by Andrew Jackson, the seventh president.  Andrew Jackson, who gained fame through his leadership in the War of 1812, was raised in rural poverty, and upon gaining the Presidency he appointed many ordinary citizens to his administration and reformed the Electoral College so that the elector votes were tied to the public vote in each state.  This system gives the public a much more direct say in the choice of the President, and it is the system that remains in place today.

As for the Senate, it took much longer before citizens had a direct say.  It wasn’t until the 1850s that momentum started growing for amending the Senate election system.  During those years and the following several decades, the public became increasingly aware of corruption within the Senate, ranging from internal state conflicts which prevented the election of any candidate in some cases, to bribery and intimidation, to muckraking journalism which portrayed the Senate as pawns for industry and finance.  This sentiment found a home in the Progressive movement, and in 1913  the Seventeenth Amendment was passed which changed the text of the Constitution to make Senators the subject of election by the people. Once again, the public gained a greater voice over the election of their officials.

The result of these changes in election systems have made Americans the most frequent voters out of all modern democracies. There are more elections, and they are staggered based on the varying term lengths for different positions - two years for the House, six for the Senate, four for the Presidency.  This system contrasts with parliamentary systems, where all legislators are chosen in the same election.  This arguably provides Americans voters with more influence over their lawmakers, since at no time is there a prolonged period of stasis within the government during which laws can be passed without the public’s influence.  For example, the President serves four years at a time, but during these years the control and composition of the House in Congress can change every two years by vote of the people.  Likewise, Senators serve for six years, but the House and the President will change during the tenure of one Senator, meaning that in all cases there exist ample opportunities for the public to check the lawmaking of the government at large by electing different lawmakers.  On the flip side, this may make it more difficult to pass certain laws or make decisions quickly because there is so much variation in lawmakers, and it also means lawmakers must spend more time playing “election politics” in which they may delay certain actions based on their hopes of becoming reelected, and increased time fundraising, as opposed to governing, may also be a side effect.","","",NA,"","2015-09-22 18:51:00","2015-09-22 18:51:00","False","","55e5fab49714b0b433000de8","5601a33701772b1b0c001f5f",2,0
5269924,"Motivator","Comment","","Federal grants in aid have played an important role in the expansion of federal authority. The justification for one is to provide for the general welfare of the United States. But to do this the federal government uses federal grants to essentially create federal laws that go beyond their implied federal powers and increase the role of the federal government in our lives, for better or worse. The justification is power. You want our money, then you will implement our policies. The money comes with strings attached. 
A great example of having strings attached to federal aid  was the lowering of the drinking age and the No Child Left Behind Act, requiring public schools to test their students annually, ***as a condition of receiving federal aid.*** The Bush adminsistration wanted to hold schools accountable for student performance and used federal spending as the means of doing so. This example as pointed out by the professor, is the rule rather than the exception. Both parties have supported, or fought the use of federal power, as it suits their policy goals.

Congress can set aside funds for roads or schools as grants to the states.  Federal Transportation grants under President Reagan were to be reduced if states refused to mandate a minimum drinking age at 21 years of age.  So states increased the drinking age to 21 to get the full federal grant.  In this way the Federal government encouraged a standard drinking age.  States could refuse the grants or accept the penalty and maintain their independence but states also compete with one another for jobs and commerce and industry.  If they raise taxes to pay for roads or schools their state may suffer when competing with other states.

The most important is not having an automatic registration.

In my opinion, keeping the registration a duty of each voter is a reminiscence of the past without reason today. It just helps governments to control the access to vote.

The great number of elections, the huge distance between politicians and voters, policial fatigue, the enormous influence of economic groups of power, and many other reasons also help to understand the lower voting rates in the US.

Nevertheless, another important reason is the two-party system. In Europe, there are much more political options than is the US.

Given the fragmentary nature of federal elections in the US, the government is much less responsive to democratic influence from voters.

The US has a large number of local, state, and federal elections, which can be overwhelming. Election day is held on a Tuesday, which can be difficult for people to manage. Given the relative lack of democratic responsiveness in the US government, many people think that voting does not matter.

The demographic groups that are most disadvantaged by US voter laws are the young, the poor, and racial minorities. They are the groups least likely to register in time for elections and to have the most difficulty in getting to the polls on election day. Voter ID laws are also designed to make it even harder for people in these groups to vote, and many states disenfranchise felons as well.

First, US citizens are responsible for registering to vote whereas in many Western European countries the government is responsible. 

Secondly, the US has many more elections (every 2 years for national level elections plus primaries with potentially even more frequent voting at the state and local levels) than most European countries. Combined with media attention being primarily focused on presidential elections, voters may either not be aware of every election they can take part in and/or suffer from voter burnout.

Finally, Voter ID laws and other restrictions placed on elections (e.g. limiting time that polls are open, difficulty obtaining absentee ballots) disenfranchise people who would otherwise be eligible to vote.

Overwhelmingly, these policies adversely affect poor, young, and minority voters because these people are less likely to have an ID and are less likely to have the money, time, and access to transportation to obtain an ID, to register, and/or to go to their precinct's polling place (e.g. because they can't take time off from work and the polls aren't open at a time when they are not working).","","",NA,"","2015-09-22 22:06:00","2015-09-22 22:06:00","False","","55e5fb8701772be57d000de0","5601d0d301772b0cb0002016",2,0

Now the Senate is also decided by popular vote, and while the Electoral College still selects the President, the Electoral College is assigned based on the popular vote.

8172215,"andylewis10","Comment","","Federal grants-in-aid came to prominence during the Johnson administration when they were used by President Johnson as part of his ‘big society’ initiative in order to exert federal government influence into areas that had, until that date, fallen within the purview of the states e.g. education and healthcare. This shift in the relationship between state and national government became known as ‘fiscal federalism’. The use of grants-in-aid peaked in the late 1970s/early 1980s before the Regan administration worked to reduce them.

Grants-in-aid allowed the Federal Government to exert control by placing conditions on the granting of aid money – this was permitted under the constitution as the money was obtained by Congress, who could therefore dictate its conditions of use when it came to be expended. States had the constitutional right to refuse the conditions, but this would also mean refusing the money - this would be tricky for the states to do given that the expectations of voters was rising in relation to the role of government in improving their lives and communities. Another legacy of Regan was the loosening of the conditions under which grant money could be used i.e. money would be directed to general areas and not specific uses within an area.

7981002,"Nikollaj","Comment","","Selective incorporation is an important term in constitutional law, a part of the long debate over the powers of the federal government versus that of the individual states. In general, it refers to how the rights outlined in the Constitution apply to the states -- and the requirement that state laws and constitutions must observe these rights.
The concept of selective incorporation first arose with the passage of the 14th Amendment after the Civil War. This amendment laid down important new rights of citizens, including the rights to equal protection and due process. It extended the rights outlined in the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, a section also known as the Bill of Rights.
In the post-Civil War era, many states passed laws that were in conflict with the federal constitution by infringing the rights of citizens. Contrary to the constitution’s language, for example, people were regularly deprived of their liberty without “due process of law,” meaning in many cases a trial by jury.
At this time, the protection of rights outlined in the original U.S. Constitution applied only to the federal government alone. State governments had their own constitutions, which did not always match the language of the federal document. Laws passed by the state only had to conform to the language of the state constitution, not the federal constitution.
After the passage of the 14th Amendment, the Supreme Court made a series of decisions that selectively applied the Bill of Rights to the individual states. Eventually the first eight Bill of Rights amendments were incorporated in this way, including the right to a trial by jury. Each state, as well as the federal government, must protect these rights of their citizens -- and no state may pass a law infringing these rights.","","",NA,"","2015-09-22 22:56:00","2015-09-22 22:56:00","False","","55e5fd599714b0069b000e5f","5601dc8701772b0cb000202e",2,0

While we can see examples from Roosevelt's New Deal and the Johnson Great Society, the dye was cast during the writing of our constitution.  Regardless of which side a founding father stood on ""States Rights"" vs ""Federalism"" when they agreed on two elements in the constitution 1. the right to tax and spend, 2. the commerce clause, the future of our nation would always be headed in the direction of a strong national government. As early as Chief Justice Marshall's court holding for the federal government, against Maryland's ability to tax the bank of the United States, the dye was cast.  State governments can't borrow--the Fed's have almost limitless power to borrow (though it requires congress to raise the limit).  The power of the purse will usually win out whether it took our nation two decades or two hundred years.  A strong national government was inevitable.  In order for states to provide the services and needs of its people they needed federal help.  This allows the Feds to place restrictions or conditions on the money they provide.  A quid pro quo so to speak.  As our nation plunged into economic crisis in the thirties, the interdependence with the national government became greater and the grants more plentiful...with conditions.

States have generally opposed expansions of federal power that intrude on their authority. The one area where states have sometimes welcomed federal intrusion is federal grants-in-aid. On the other hand, States have fought to reduce as much as possible federal restrictions on use of the money.

The federal government has the ability to influence state behavior despite the constitutional limits. One of the more significant ways that the federal government can encourage state behavior is to impose conditions on the receipt of federal monies by the states. Considering the large amount of funds provided to states by the federal government, this represents a significant power for Congress to exercise. These grant conditions may allow Congress to indirectly achieve compliance by a state in a way
that could not be achieved directly.","","",NA,"","2015-09-23 04:38:00","2015-09-23 04:38:00","False","","55e5fc1a01772b01c2000e19","56022cc701772b38df001f95",2,0

1. Whether the system of elections is better now compared to the original method? Yes, certainly. Because the constitutionally, the state cannot deprive anybody the right to vote based on gender or race. The principle of ""All men are created equal"" is upheld.

2. Whether this system of staggered and separate elections is better? I don't think so. While a lot of time and money are wasted in lobbying, the real motive is lost along with its sanctity. It also gives more opportunity for the grievances and demands of the richer to be addressed than those who are not so rich and hence cannot be powerful and influential. This can be thought of as just an easier method of conducting elections considering the population of the country. But if examined, this method has a lot drawbacks to the concept of people's government i.e Democracy. More often than not, people's voices and demands are not addressed. 

A better way, as suggested by drpallavijugale and even though being slightly more tedious would be to eliminate indirect elections. Now, in order to make it easier relatively, restrictions can be imposed on the methods of conducting primary election by the state. By either trying to make it a uniform method or conducting all during a single span of time. Also, to reduce spending, electronic ways of campaigning can be adopted which can prove to be more effective and result-oriented.

The Bill of Rights protected civil liberties of the people from the federal government but not state and local governments who had become oppressive concerning these civil liberties. 
Beginning in 1925, the Supreme Court cited the due process clause of the 14th amendment in a number of opinions. It was these opinions that extended the rights protected in the Bill of Rights from the federal government to the states. This process is called selective incorporation because only specific rights included in the Bill of Rights are extended to state and local governments.
This process has been crucial in protecting civil liberties at the state and local levels because, generally, these are the two institutions involved in enforcing laws and as a result, are more likely to infringe on these rights.

The American system of check and balance is embodied in the political-institutional framework and the minority vs. the majority balance. Following the Aristotelian concept of a balanced democracy (as against a ""mob rule""), the framers of the Constitution opted for the House members to be elected through direct voting (similar to the way the British House of Commons members are chosen) and the Senate through an indirect way (reminiscent of the way the House of Lords members are chosen. But through time, the way Senators are elected has also become more direct.
Geography i.e. size of territory and difficulty of communication may have influenced their decision at that time. But generally, it may not be that simple to conclude that a parliamentary system is more ""democratic"" than an indirect representation or a mixture of both.People may exercise their rights directly or through their representatives. So, a relatively small and homogeneous country like the UK may allow all citizens to do it all at once. For the US , two centuries ago, this might not have been that easy. So we cannot say that citizens have more impact and influence upon their governments than those under mixed system of representation.

When it comes to the electoral college to elect the president -- although the voter is not directly voting for the president, the electoral college votes count towards the president. So, I guess it is fair. 
However, the gerrymandering puts a damper on the whole situation with the elections in general.
Given the fact that a lot of people were excluded from voting in the beginning, today's voters have a huge advantage despite the voter ID laws.

Contrasting this to the German system, e.g., the chancellor isn't elected directly as well. The members of the House, that is the ""Bundestag,"" elect the chancellor. In addition, since there is a multi-party system (1) in Germany, the votes are divided among several parties. And usually, none of the parties make it over 50%. So, they have to go into a coalition. And the party with the most votes might not be part of the administration. Since every German owns a state-issued ID, voter registration isn't a problem. You don't have to register at all for an election. German citizens are informed via mail about the next election, and all the citizen has to do, show up,  bring the notification and show the ID.

Unfortunately, there is no limit on how many times the chancellor can be reelected.

(1) In order to make into the German parliament, the party needs to make the 5% hurdle.

1241001,"cdt071","Comment","","Arguments in favor of invoking the commerce clause to support the Affordable Care Act include the costs to healthcare in general, and the overall economy, of the large number of uninsured individuals. This economic burden of the sick who are unable to pay their own medical expenses requires some form of government intervention, which being in response to an economic issue would theoretically fall under the commerce class. On the other hand, the issue in question of an insurance mandate that technically involves a *lack* of commerce, and in which government effectively requires individuals to engage in commerce against their will, logically eliminates the commerce clause as the relevant constitutional provision on which to rest the ACA.

If the penalty assessed to the uninsured is viewed as a ""tax"" rather than a punishment (a subtle distinction), the ACA could be supported as Constitutional under the tax and spend clause that authorizes congress to assess taxes for the general welfare. However, since the specific language in the act stipulates that the fee in question is a *penalty*, not a tax, it would require the Court to essentially ""rewrite"" the legislation according to their interpretation to make it fit the clause, something which the Court arguably does not have the authority to do.

While I support the idea of accessible and affordable healthcare, this aspect of the Act -- and the Court's ruling on it -- is one with which I would have to disagree. There is no support, in my opinion, within either of these clauses to allow government to compel its citizens to purchase anything, (similarly I have concerns about governmental prohibitions on the purchase of goods and services). It is a slippery slope to start allowing a tax-happy government another avenue by which to extract money in the name of some poorly defined ""general welfare"". There are consequences to the US economy from those who don't have cell phones, Internet, cars, pets . . . you name it. Is it now permissible to assess a ""penalty"" to anyone who chooses not to avail themselves of these other significant parts of the economy? I'm sure corporations and lobbyists are burning the midnight oil as we speak, trying to figure out what legislation is next needed that requires greater consumption to benefit the, um, ""general"" welfare.

The healthcare issue is significant and needs to be addressed. If taxation is needed to help pay for indigent care, so be it. Impose a tax, call it a tax, and clearly define precisely how it is to be used to a stated purpose. Unfortunately, the SCOTUS has chosen instead to amend legislation as written to open the door to an expanded use of the tax and spend clause, in which a tax is not a tax.","","",NA,"","2015-09-23 13:41:00","2015-09-23 13:41:00","False","","55e5fc969714b01c9d000e1f","5602ac1901772bf07a002214",2,0

This power given by the grants to the federal state is not imposed on the states: they can refuse the money...but few do and none in most areas.

Only members of the house were elected by popular vote, whereas the Senate was chosen by State legislature and the President was chooses by electors of each state. However eventually it was realized that senators should be chosen by popular vote also and there was a constitutional amendment that was passed that insured they would now be put in office by popular vote. 
The U.S. system of staggered voting prevents government from taking a “clean sweep” in office when elections come forth. What that means due to the differing time periods that each office is elected, the party that receives majority at that time will likely be determined by the events that have recently unfolded before that current election. And since events around the world and at home are constantly changing this often makes sure that there is no party that has complete control over the presidency, the house, and the senate. The U.S. system provides more influence over lawmakers because when we see situations where the same party controls all three aspects they are able to pass laws without question and without debate, and when that occurs it often negatively effects the nation as a whole.

Why?
Voter turnout varies between countries is high because of differences between nations which tend to be greater than those between classes, ethnic groups or religions within nations. 
In the U.S. cultural factors are significant like wealth or literacy. 
Demographics aspects have also an effect on voting turnouts. For example in Europe live more older people as in the U.S. so that is why the older people in Europe tend to vote more than youths in the U.S. this is why societies where the average is somewhat higher such as Europe have automatically higher turnouts. 
The next argument which should be mentioned in matters of lower turnouts in the U.S. is the fact that the voter registration caused a problem for the U.S. voter. Voter registration has an impact on voter turnout. Europe had elimited bourocraticsm and this can result in higher voter turnouts. 
Another point: the U.S. through separate voter registration procedures before they are allowed to vote and this two step process decreases turnout. The U.S. with no, or easier registration requirements could have an easier way to rise turnouts. 
Another point: the most important socioeconomic factor affectiny voter turnout is education, the more likely educated person, the more likely is voting.
Moreover we can not forget that in the U.S. black voters did not full enjoy the right to vote for many years after the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because of intimidation, discrimination and tactics such as literacy tests and poll taxes and harassment directed at blacks, especially in the South.

Incorporations as liberty, life and property rights have been the most important developments in the History of American Civil Liberties. Today American citizens enjoy rights as Fair Trail Protection, which includes limited warrantless police searches, defendant’s right to trial by an impartial jury, outlaw double jeopardy and the right to silence warning known as Miranda Rights. Moreover, it impacted greatly on how the national press disclose government information, as it occurred with Lyndon Johnsons’ government regarding the unpopular Vietnam’s military conflict. It is vital to make clear that Selective incorporation is not a law, but has been established over time through court cases and rulings by the United States Supreme Court. At its heart, selective incorporation is about the ability of the federal government to limit the states' lawmaking powers (Magloff, L., Demand Media).

2318350,"CageyKid","Comment","","Selective incorporation is the legal term that protects the immunities, rights and privileges of all citizens of the US from various state laws.  Selective incorporation is a result of the debate over incorporation of the Bill of Rights into the middle of the United States Constitution itself.  This process has been ongoing from the time of the Philadelphia Convention, when the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists each fought to have their views become a focal factor for the new Constitution.
The Federalists favored a strong Federal Government; the Anti-Federalists pushed for more individual freedoms.  In more modern times, this process of selective incorporation is well expressed in the 14th Amendment as a means to help clarify the question over the incorporation of the Bill of Rights.
After the passage of the 14th Amendment, the US Supreme Court helped to judge the value of our individual rights and how they are affected by the powers of the US Federal Government.  The result of the Court’s work, over the years, has led to the incorporation of the Bill of Rights as a means to protect citizens against the states abusing the powers ascribed to them.  In order to do so, almost all of the first 10 Amendments have found their way into incorporation as a means of restricting State governments.

At the outset of our Founding, the Bill of Rights and it's provisions applied only to the federal government - it was not applicable to the states. Thus, while Congress ""could make no law respecting an establishment of religion,"" nothing prohibited a state government from having a state church. Thus, it was possible for a fledgling Mormon movement to be persecuted in Illinois and Missouri and they could not stand on their 1st Amendment right, since back then the 14th Amendment did not exist. If such a case happened today, the court would most likely overturn such state actions and apply the Bill of Rights to that state.

8086935,"MurrayHunter","Comment","","The Supreme Court's ruling that the legislation to enact the Affordable Care Act was constitutional provided those in lower economic circumstances to enhancements in Medicaid programs, expended those who qualified for Medicaid and provided a subsidy to modest income earners to purchase health insurance. The Act also allowed many individuals to become eligible to purchase health insurance who had pre-existing health conditions and could not have their policies cancelled or have limits on coverage when they became ill. Larger businesses were also required to pay for health insurance for their employees. The benefit of this legislation was to bridge the gap between the wealthy who could afford health care with those who could not or who could only afford a lower standard of coverage.

The argument against this ruling was that individuals have the right to choose whether or not to pay for their health coverage and the type of coverage they want. The imposition of a penalty for not complying is similar to a tax. At the time the legislation came into being there were not a sufficient number of care providers to meet the demand of all of the new individuals who entered the system. Private health care providers began to select those patients who had adequate plans to pay for their services and rejected those with insurance plans that were not able to pay for the rates sought by the providers. The imposition of mandatory coverage for employees by corporations was an additional cost that was difficult to recover by increases in their pricing of products and services. In effect , this legislation imposed additional costs to all consumers.","","",NA,"","2015-09-23 20:18:00","2015-09-23 20:18:00","False","","55e5fc969714b01c9d000e1f","560309329714b0f1ff000cfe",2,0

Initially, only the House of Representatives was elected by the people and the Senate & President were not. This has obviously changed and now the majority of government officials are elected by vote of the people. But even until the 1960's many Americans were unable to cast a ballot due to suffrage, racism, local & federal laws, and discriminatory voter regulations. Today, all Americans have the right & ability to register and to vote - though many chose not to exercise this right, as seen by increasingly lower voter turnout each year. The U.S. system of staggered and separate elections for House members, senators, and the President provides voters greater influence over lawmakers compared with a parliamentary system where all legislators are chosen in the same election. By conducting staggered and separate elections, voters can make greater change in their government through their elected officials due in part to more opportunity to re-elect and/or elect new representation. This system allows the people to potentially change and shift the political landscape on a more consistent and regular basis than choosing all legislators in the same election - it gives more electoral power to the people.","","",NA,"","2015-09-23 20:23:00","2015-09-23 20:23:00","False","","55e5fa6201772bc852000dac","56030a4c01772bdebd001fa7",2,0

The fact this program existed at all for years without our knowledge or general knowledge in Congress (outside of certain committees) is an egregious breach of our Constitutional rights. The fact that Edward Snowden, who exposed this illegal and problematic program, is being treated as a traitor rather than an American hero is also extremely problematic.

Even with the revisions in the Patriot Act or the new Freedom Act, the program is still highly problematic. Just because the NSA is not storing the data anymore does not alleviate the fact that normal, everyday, law-abiding Americans are caught up in a net of hyper surveillance. 

Americans, especially those born around the time of 9/11 have traded in their security and civil rights for the false sense of security, when our country's War on Terror has only increased militant extremist groups. We are not safer despite these intrusions into our privacy. 

There are no arguments in support of the program.

622743,"SunShineStateGirl","Comment","","The justices agreed the individual mandate did not fall under the commerce clause - one argument was that government can regulate commerce but citizens can't be forced to participate in commerce.  The argument was for the mandate was a wonderful example of legal chicanery.  The first hurdle to the individual mandate was whether the ACA mandate tax could even be argued because of the anti-injunction act; thus the Court ruled the mandate wasn't a tax but a penalty.  However, they then said it was constitutionally a tax so thus legal under Congress's taxing powers.  They found the mandate was an indirect tax as opposed to a direct tax; had it been a direct tax then it would have failed the Anti-Injunction act.  Direct taxes tax people; indirect taxes tax transactions - so refusing to engage in commerce - even though the court just said you couldn't be forced to do that is engaging in a transaction that makes you liable for the tax.  As others have described it - it is a tax on breathing - which sounds like a capitation tax - which again would be void under the Anti-Injunction Act.  What this proves is that skilled law school graduates can contrive an argument for whatever they want to accomplish.

I would have rejected it as unconstitutional - the bottom line is that people too poor to buy insurance have to pay a penalty to provide lower cost insurance to people putting even less into the system.  I would have found it a direct tax and subject to the Anti Injunction Act. Though if I'd been the attorney I would have argued on several more grounds including the tenth amendment; it was put there for a purpose and it's eradication is not viewed as a good thing by all.  I have another argument I would have used as well considering this is a direct wealth transfer from those who pay the penalty to those who do not and those without insurance do not get any benefit from the ACA; they do not get free treatment at the ER - unless they are here illegally; and medical costs are a leading cause of individual bankruptcy so some people have been put in a very hazardous condition because of this law.","","",NA,"","2015-09-23 21:19:00","2015-09-23 21:19:00","False","","55e5fc969714b01c9d000e1f","5603176f9714b0b4330021b5",2,0

The framers of the Constitution feared that direct democracy could become a tyranny. They didn't want the majority to take control over the minority, so they limited direct popular influence.
Senators were chosen by the state legislatures and the president was chosen by electors (each state had as many electors as it had members in Congress) . Today, senators are chosen by popular vote, and the president is still voted by electors, but voters now have a more direct voice in the election process. 

Contrary to parliamentary system, in which officials are elected at the same time and for the same term of office, the US system staggers and separates elections.

2003550,"cirqueminime","Comment","","According to Lisa Magloff of Demand Media, on Legal Zoom :

    http://info.legalzoom.com/meant-selective-incorporation-20152.html

“Selective incorporation” is a constitutional doctrine that ensures states cannot enact laws that take away the constitutional rights of American citizens that are enshrined in the Bill of Rights.

As “doctrines” go, this one seems benign enough, keeping the citizen safe from predations of the “backward and unwashed” denizens of the American “profond”, the deeper recesses of the yet-to-be civilized ‘frontiers’.  But when they come into conflict, Rights—being merely legally sanctioned Interests, whether of the States or the Federal government—all too often create situations wherein the defense of one person’s Rights becomes the violation of another’s.  The granting of the rights of  U.S. citizenship to the former chattel of ancient plantation owners dispossessed those julep-sipping horse-traders of some very valuable and productive (human) property.  But, as Lincoln might’ve said, “What’s right is right.  Right?”

Its outcomes are sometimes problematic.  Whether the granting of a **Business Monopoly** to a New Orleans slaughterhouse in the first Supreme Court ruling on the 14th Amendment in 1873; or Ted Cruz’s sun-stroked notion that the Supreme Court (on the Colbert Late Show the Texas Teabagger describes the Highest Court in the Land as ‘**five** unelected lawyers who determine the moral destiny of the American People’ without a popular mandate) has no jurisdiction to rule on **marriage** because that institution is not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution and is, therefore, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the States. 

And then with the recent roll-back of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the calming of Affirmative Action, justified by the presence of a Black Man in the White House, it seems that Selective Incorporation has continued stoking the fires of States’ Rights.

2421530,"KittyChandler","Comment","","There are a number of reasons why voting rates in the United States are lower than in Europe, one of them being the pride in individualism previously discussed. Rebelling against voting and the necessity of voting is seen as an act of protest or a statement of the futility of voting by some, the sentiment often expressed being “my vote won't count so why bother.” This is of course a fallacy, as borne out in the numerous local elections where the winning margin was fifty votes or less. But then this also is a contributing factor: the voter turnout for Presidential elections is far greater than the turnout for midterm or local elections, primarily because the connection between local and Congressional elections and the decisions made on how an area (county, township, state, or national) is governed is very rarely drawn in a clear and emphasized manner. Simply put, many many people don't care about elections other than the Presidential and sometimes the Congressional seats. Therefore voting is much devalued and in many cases, given up on.

The comic writer Warren Ellis devoted a particular plotline of his series Transmetropolitan to elections and voting, including one page in which the main character Spider Jerusalem describes the popular opinion of voting. While vividly descriptive, it is also sadly accurate.

Voter registration is also a barrier. The dates and duration and times when a person can register to vote before the next election are highly variable depending on the state, and can be very confusing if a person has recently moved from one state to another. Voter registration is dependent on the individual, so if a person moves or if a person changes their name, or any other item on the registration is altered it is the responsibility of that person to change the item on the voter registration. And it is not always clear how to do that; voter registration cards are mailed once a year to confirm the information, and they are easily lost. Voter registration drives are often held in neighborhoods that value the election process, but that is likewise variable. It is true that the importance of voting and registration is becoming more and more emphasized in recent days, assisted by the presence of socially and politically active citizens on social media. But that also depends on the registration process being accessible, which has become less and less true also in recent days with the increase in voter ID laws and restrictions on hours of accessibility. Voter ID laws, though meant to combat a form of voter fraud that has not been proven to exist let alone in the record numbers its proponents claim, primarily serve as a tax on the time and finances of the people who do not have a driver's license or other commonly accepted form of identification. Driver's licenses or state IDs are expensive, require documentation (social security card, birth certificate, and often a third and sometimes a fourth form of identification from a short list, usually which has a social security number on it, not always including a tax record) which many people do not possess or cannot lay immediate hands on, require going to a Department or Bureau of Vehicles during business hours, not all of these facilities are accessible by anything other than a motor vehicle, just to name a handful of the most common obstacles to getting an ID. It is not as simple as Voter ID law proponents would either like it to be or would like to make it sound, and the laws restrict both the registration process and the voting process itself to those who have the resources to thread that particular needle.

US voting procedure, as stated, means that voting takes place on a Tuesday when many people are working. Not everyone can take the time off work to vote, and although polling places open early and stay open late to facilitate this around work hours, this does not help when a person is working two jobs, or working a job and taking care of children which is essentially in time and availability working another job as well. Early voting is also meant to compensate, but several states have already cut the early voting days to a single week, not always enough time or warning to secure time off in order to vote. Then there is the matter of the polling places, usually a school or a library or some other public facility designed to be central to the bulk of the local population, but recently there have been instances documented of the polling places being moved without warning and adequate time to adjust plans, leaving many people who had already calculated their voting and travel time to minimize their time off work in the lurch as they now have to recalculate as well as find out where the polling is taking place. The bulk of the people disenfranchised by this and by alleged voter fraud laws are people without resources, usually of particular races or economic brackets, who are most invested in electing a person who will advocate for them in whatever body they are meant to be representing to. The practical result of this is that the elected officials are elected by those who already possess resources of their own and are not in need of assistance, who are then able to assist politicians into office who will then legislate according to the constituency that elected them, rather than their general constituency, and who can perpetuate the resources of those who elected them.","","",NA,"","2015-09-24 03:08:00","2015-09-24 03:08:00","False","","55e5fb5c9714b07ea7000db4","5603692c01772bea80001fd2",2,0

This is a divergence from the original intent of the Constitution makers who also feared the tyranny of the people and actual democracy.
The staggered and separate elections to offices which are derived from the same constituency- the people ( In the same federal level) make the candidate running for any of the offices always mindful of the necessities, but the campaigns and money spending involved make them prone to supporting certain vested interests. Moreover, the term of the House is too short too do something substantial before another election is imminent. All the federal offices have competitive positions with the same constituency and loose party affiliations which allows for lesser co-ordination but more one-upmanship. In parliamentary democracies following the Westminster Model, like the UK or India, there is not direct elections to the upper chambers in the Parliament or for the President, but the executive and the legislatures are constituted by one election, leading to less time campaigning, no overlapping terms of office hence a more consistent and co-ordinated policy, state rights protection and greater checks and balances on the executive by the legislature if there isn't a cabinet dictatorship.

Only the House of Representatives would be chosen by a vote of the people. As for the President, Electoral College method is applied, where Each state would have as many electors as it had members of Congress, House and Senate combined. The state legislatures would choose the electors, and the candidate with the majority of the electoral votes would become president.

Now, the popular election is applied for senators also through primary elections where the voters rather than the party organisations chose the nominees. As for voting for the president, the system today is that the winner of a state's popular vote receives its electoral votes, which give the voters a decisive say in the choice of the president. Thus, The presidency, House, and Senate were now all subject to vote of the people, who had two chances to be heard, once in the primary and once in the general election.
The U.S. system of staggered and separate elections for House members, senators, and the president provides voters greater influence over lawmakers than a parliamentary system where all legislators are chosen in the same election. Because through many elections, the voters can exercise their choice again and again, they have the time to think twice and change their votes later if they think that the nominees are not satisfied. While in the system where there is only one election, the voters have only once chance to exercise the right of choosing their representative.

As originally written, the Constitution did not provide for the right to vote. Some Americans were held in slavery and were denied even citizenship. Besides, women did not get the right to vote until 1920. The original Constitution had a single clause on voting. It gave the states authority to determine voting eligibility in federal elections. It has been used at times to deny some people the right to vote.
•  In the early history of the United States, most states denied the vote to males without property, states also deny the vote on the basis of race or color. Literacy tests and poll taxes were adopted to limit the right to vote of people.
Moreover, it is the voter registration system, which is handled differently in the United States than in Europe also contributes to the low voting rate in the U.S. In European democracies, government assumes responsibility for registering voters. If a citizen moves to a new address, for example, the postal service will notify election officials to change the individual's registration. Whilst in the U.S., registration is the individual's responsibility. Eligible citizens must personally take the time to register, which in some case, if they neglect to register, this can affect the voting rate.
By U.S. voting laws, the young, poor, and minorities are most disadvantaged because of the voter ID laws which requires an applicant to have a government-issued photo ID such as a driver's license or passport in order to register. They are designed to make it difficult for those without a formal ID to register. About 10% of vote-eligible citizens do not have a government-issued identification card.

The Federal Government is the responsible for the general welfare and that’s why it can tax the states and also it is able to determinate how they must spend that budget, in other words the government can determinate how to spend the grants-in-aid because the government is the responsible to the Americans welfare. For instance, the government can order to the states how much they must invest in education (buildings, teacher, supplies…) because is the government the called to guarantee the right of education in the country.

The sting has come out of it somewhat, but there is still an uneasiness to this bill. The Supreme Court’s ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Healthcare Act’s mandate for all persons to have healthcare or else be subject to a fine is, for all intents and purposes, a stale mate. This is one of the reasons for the Supreme Court to have only nine judges, so that there can never be a tie. Both sides presented very good arguments. On the pro side, the justices argued that the Internal Revenue Code 5000A, as read as a command, is unconstitutional because the federal government cannot force people to buy health insurance. However, they argued that if 5000A is read as a tax, then it is permissible and, therefore, constitutional. On the opposing side, the justices argued that redefining how the statute is to be read is almost as if the entire statute is rewritten, and in essence, a legislative responsibility not to be carried out by the judicial branch of government. 

The troubling case of NFIB v Sebelius has been a continued social struggle. The intent of the statute is encouraging by mandating universal healthcare. In a sense, the heart is in the right place. However, it is discouraging to impose such a heavy tax or penalty. It truly is unclear as to whether this is a fine, and therefore illegal, as if it is a crime to not have health insurance. I would vote that the mandate is unconstitutional and should be removed from the statute, until such time as a new idea can be implemented.

Federal grants-in-aid allow the federal government to administer cash payments to states with stipulations.  States can of course refuse the money, as Arizona did for nearly 20 years with Medicaid.  But the addition of free funding for programs, allows states to divert their own spending elsewhere (am I correct here?).  Consequently, states may compromise on their own ideals and principles in some cases, in order to accept the grants.  Federal authority is thus expanded across state lines, and as it becomes the norm, programs are embedded within the states.

The IRS holds the citizens accountable to pay taxes. The monies are pooled together and distributed as the Federal Government sees fit. The information below may interest you.

In fiscal year 2015, the Federal budget was 3.8 trillion dollars. The U.S. Treasury divides all federal spending into three groups: mandatory spending, discretionary spending and interest on debt. Mandatory and discretionary spending account for more than ninety percent of all federal spending, and pay for all of the government services and programs on which we rely. Interest on debt, which is a much smaller amount than the other two categories, is the interest the government pays on its accumulated debt, minus interest income received by the government for assets it owns. 

Here is a pie chart that shows more clearly government spending.

And here is a chart on how the discretionary spending is divided up.

From the 1960's to the 1980's, federal grants rose an astounding 422%, from 45 billion dollars to 190 billion dollars. While during the Reagan years, as a result of a variety of initiatives and incentives, federal grants decreased 29%. 

In 2015, the federal government is expected to grant over 628 billion dollars to states for a variety of needs. While the U.S. Constitution reserves power to the states to decide on their policy, if the states chooses to accept federal funds, then the states must adhere to the reasonable conditions set forth. Keep in mind, the states are not obligated to accept federal funds. Arizona, for example, did not have medicaid for 20 years.

It spends hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars each year on subsidy programs—from the massive Medicare to hundreds of more obscure programs that most people have never heard of. 

Fraud in the two main federal health programs is huge, imposing costs on taxpayers at least in the tens of billions of dollars each year. Malcolm Sparrow of Harvard University, a top specialist in health care fraud, argues that estimates by federal auditors do not measure all types of fraud. He believes that as much as 20 percent of federal health program budgets are consumed by fraud and abuse, which would be about $85 billion a year for Medicare.

As a result, the U.S. Government developed the GAO or Government Accountability Office. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) is an independent, nonpartisan agency that works for Congress. Often called the ""congressional watchdog,"" GAO investigates how the federal government spends taxpayer dollars. The head of GAO, the Comptroller General of the United States, is appointed to a 15-year term by the President from a slate of candidates Congress proposes. 

There mission is to support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance and ensure the accountability of the federal government for the benefit of the American people. 

While the system is not perfect, it is pretty darn good.

-	PROS: 
o	It is a tax because: The Federal government is in its right to regulate this tax because, it is in charge of the general welfare, hence it should be able to impose a tax in order to get the goal of ensure the health of the whole population.
-	CON: 
o	Even when the Federal Government is able to tax the states, it mustn't use this power to pressure them or the people to get what it wants. 
o	Some of the justices said that what the court did was change completely the sense of the law in the way it was clearly a punishment (“if you don’t do this you’ll get that”) and now the court just said it was a tax only to make it “constitutional” because as a punishment it is an unconstitutional pressure over the people, but as a tax it is under the Taxing clause.

**COMMERCE CLAUSE:** This clause gives to the congress the power to regulate interstate commerce.
-	PROS: 
o	Some of the justices supported the law under this clause arguing that the health care is an interstate issue, keeping in mind that the patients have to get huge amounts of medicine (commerce) or even sometimes they move from one State to other to get a bigger health coverture. 
-	CONS:
o	That law goes beyond of this clause statements
o	To accept this law under the commercial clause means to give to the clause a super expand range that it didn't have in the first and is a risk to the figure of the Federal government, because is enforcing in a big way the national and making weak the States

**Personally I disagree with the final decision**, Under my point of view this is a punishment, because if you have to pay for don’t get a service that you don’t want or that you don’t think is necessary for yourself, why should you pay for that decision? I also think this is in some way an abuse to the right of freedom. 
What is a tax? A tax is an amount of money you pay to get a service or a benefice from the state back, through the taxes you can get education, good road among others. You’ll always have to pay those taxes if you are in a determinate economic situation; but in this case, you have to pay a “tax” just if you don’t do what the government wants you to do. This is more like if you don’t pay your taxes you’ll have to pay an extra amount of money. And what is that amount of money? It is a punishment.
In those terms I think This a dangerous Judicial precedent.","","",NA,"","2015-09-25 02:18:00","2015-09-25 02:18:00","False","","55e5fc969714b01c9d000e1f","5604aef601772bf07a0023d1",2,0

One of the roles the federal grants have played is the assistance given to low-income Americans and minorities,working families and the economically vulnerable as well, who have a greater need for such assistance.These came at time when the Democrats controlled the Congress and when the states could not provide the basic amenities necessary for survival.The aids therefor became the prime instrument of the Great Society.Such aids by the federal government to the states would be used by the states and localities for predetermined purposes exclusively. A perfect example is the Medicaid Program ,which gave federal assistance to provide health insurance to Americans with incomes below the poverty line.The federal aid in addition to this ,also took away from the states and localities ,the burden of having to generate such funds by taxing its residents.Thirdly,the aids helped foster the relationship between the federal government and their state counterparts.
As the saying goes however:"" there is no free coffee in New York"",these federal aids came with some prerequisites and strings attached which the receiving states and localities must adhere strictly to.  Basically,since the funds were appropriated by Congress,Congress therefore had the constitutional authority to determine and such monies were to be utilized.Some of these funds represented a meagre 10% (in the case of school funding) of the total money spent by state governments on schools,so the choices of the states are limited on how to spend these monies.The reason for justifying the control of how these funds were to be spent by Congress was that Congress before deciding to allocate such funds had some set of policy directions which in some cases ,they were not constitutionally empowered to effect such policies ,used such control of federal aids to coerce the states if they decided to accept such funds.","","",NA,"","2015-09-25 02:49:00","2015-09-25 02:49:00","False","","55e5fc1a01772b01c2000e19","5604b61f01772b2feb0021b4",2,0

For years, and through various Presidency's, there have been many attempts to improve the health care system, to make it fair. As a result, today it is by law that all citizens have health insurance. If you cannot afford it, you must file a health coverage exemption or pay a fine. And I think that is fair. Keep in mind, it is not a mandate. But, a tax. If you purchase health insurance, you will not be taxed. 

What are the taxes, or fines?  Here is a link.

If you choose to not purchase health insurance and pay the tax, then become ill, the costs for health care will most likely bankrupt you. For that reason, it is best to take part in a national health care system where everyone shares the cost. 

The ACA benefits all citizens. It grants certain services for free; it provides for ethical and non-discriminating health clauses, and it ensures a more equitable role in costs. The ACA is designed to improve the health of it's citizens by encouraging preventive health measures.

Here is a link for free services:

The ACA ruling also let states opt-out of expanding Medicaid. Almost half of the U.S. States opted out of expanding Medicaid in 2014 (as of October 2013) leading to 5.9 million of our nation’s poorest without access to affordable health insurance. This is unfortunate.

Although the Affordable Care Act was upheld by the Supreme Court ruling, we should all keep in mind that upcoming elections will have a major impact on the success of reforming health care and health insurance in the United States.

As states face budget deficits, it is the federal government that can fill it as the states may not also borrow from foreign governments.They have an inherent limitation to levy taxes to the desirable level as that would force firms and residents move to states with less stringent tax legislation. 

Although constitutionally sovereign, states' fiscal constraints as opposed to the national government's extensive power to raise money through taxation, sovereign debt and the national bank has kept them fiscally dependent on the central government. Fiscal federalism has a negative impact on the independence of states but has proved to be a very good instrument of carrying out the intent of the framers i.e. building a strong national government.

It is important to the American people because the states which hitherto did not recognize these rights and so accused person were being deprived of their right to life ,liberty and property without due process of the law which includes a right to a fair trial.It is worthy to note that without these,the states would have turned the American society into savages!It is through this selective incorporation that people accused of crimes can still get their rights read to them and can talk of their rights being violated not minding they are still accused.Something still far fetched in most countries of the world till date.

Judges considered that the commerce clause authorizes Congress to regulate interstate commerce but no to order individuals to engage in it.
But the court ended up in uphelding the individual mandate basing on Congress's taxing power. They said that event the law used the term 'penalty', the payment the individual was forced to do was a tax. So they sentenced that Congress had used it's power to tax to increase taxe on those who have enough income but choose to go without health insurance. Judges concluded that the individual mandate on the Health Care Act is within Congress's power to tax.

5269924,"Motivator","Comment","","Selective incorporation is the process of bringing the fair trial rights in the Bill of Rights into the 14th Amendment and most important it is the process, whereby rights contained in the Bill of Rights are extended to the state governments by the 14th Amendment. It is ""selective"" because only particular rights in the Bill of Rights are given protection. And it's called ""incorporation"" because the process involves incorporating, or bringing into the 14th Amendment, rights that are contained in the Bill of Rights, thus protecting them from state action. 
Selective incorporation is one of the most important developments in the history of American civil liberties. State and local governments are more likely to violate your individual civil rights. The rights contained in the Bill of rights pertained to the federal government not state and local governments. This was because the writers of the constitution had a deep seated fear of a big central national government intruding on people’s rights. That was based largely on British Imperialism and colonists’ experience of European monarchs.  Even today, many Americans still have a distrust of the federal government but it is the state and local governments who are actually more likely to intrude on people's rights. As the professor pointed out, the major reason is that state and local officials have primary responsibility for policing and for maintaining public order. Therefore situations where citizens are most likely to come into conflict with authorities will be at their state and local level. Another reason why 95% or more of alleged civil rights violations are at the state and local level is because the wrongdoers thought they could get away with it knowing that the Bill of Rights was written for the federal government not state and local governments. The 14th Amendment and the Supreme Court's application of it to the actions of the states and localities has protected more  Americans' rights.  It oddly enough has put limits on power and misuse of power at the state and local level by nationalizing the Bill of Rights and is a check on state and local power not just the federal government. The Landmark decsions by the Supreme Court are tangible evidence of rights being being protected and the complexities as well.

If constitutional violations are committed by the state, a person can appeal to federal courts such as the SCOTUS. This is what happened in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963). 

Selective incorporation has brought about a further and more concrete guaranteeing of constitutional rights since violations of such rights are more likely to be performed by local or state officials than by federal officials (as exhibited by the FBI versus local police example given by Professor Patterson in the lecture.)

7512985,"IrinaBulici","Comment","","The doctrine of incorporation has been traced back to Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad v. City of Chicago (1897) in which the Supreme Court appeared to require some form of just compensation for property appropriated by state or local authorities (even though there was a state statute on the books that provided the same guarantee).

And even further back to 1873 when the Supreme Court ruled in the Slaughterhouse case of New Orleans.

As a result, since that time, the Court has steadily incorporated most of the significant provisions of the Bill of Rights into a process known as ""selective incorporation"". 

Incorporation applies both procedurally and substantively to the guarantees of the states. Thus, procedurally, only a jury can convict a defendant of a serious crime via the 6th Amendment; substantively, for example, states must recognize the 1st Amendment prohibition against a state-established religion, regardless of whether state laws and constitutions offer such a prohibition.

The 1st, 2nd, and 4th Amendments have been incorporated in total.

Some rights of the 5th, 6th and 8th Amendments have been incorporated.

And none of the 3rd or 7th Amendment have been incorporated.

6513402,"sbrg","Comment","","The fact is that prior to 1925, the Bill of Rights was held only to apply to the federal government. For example, the Supreme Court in 1833 held in Barron v. Baltimore that the Bill of Rights applied only to the federal, but **not any state governments**; even years after the ratification of the 14th Amendment, the Supreme Court in 1876 in United States v. Cruikshank still held that the 1st and 2nd Amendment **did not apply to state governments**. 

Therefore historically looking, it was a major breakthrough that the process of selective incorporation started beginning of 1920s. 

Justice Hugo Black pointed out that the Slaughter-House Cases did not directly involve any right enumerated in the Constitution:

> Blockquote

The state law under consideration in the Slaughter-House cases was only challenged as one which authorized a monopoly, and the brief for the challenger properly conceded that there was ""no direct constitutional provision against a monopoly."" The argument did not invoke any specific provision of the Bill of Rights, but urged that the state monopoly statute violated ""the natural right of a person"" to do business and engage in his trade or vocation.

> Blockquote

Thus, in Black's view, **the Slaughterhouse Cases should not impede incorporation of the Bill of Rights against the states**, via the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the 14th Amendment.

In the U.S. system, state and local governments have primary responsibility for law enforcement and public safety, therefore average lay person is all the more likely to experience the need for protection of individuals' rights at that level of government than federal.","","",NA,"","2015-09-26 14:43:00","2015-09-26 14:43:00","False","5602e6a201772bc6510022c3","55e5fd599714b0069b000e5f","5606af2101772b1b0c002303",3,0

The house of representatives are chosen for a 2 year term by the people.  So the voters acquired a more direct voice now than before.

According to the presidential system of government (as is the case in the U.S.), the house of representatives are elected by the people for a 2 year term, the President is elected for a 4 year term and the senators are elected for a 6 year term.

Minority group could mean a handful of Democrats living in a town that is overwhelmingly Republican or vice versa.  Large governments such as our Federal Government, is run by citizens from all across the country with a wide variety of beliefs.  This has a tendency of limiting extremism.

For example, the sheriff may be the mayor's brother and the city clerk his sister-in-law with a cousin as a local judge.  Selective incorporation recognized this danger and so uses the power of the (hopefully) more moderate Federal Government to protect the rights of citizens against more extreme local governments.  This was seen in the civil rights movement in the 1960s where many state and local governments in the South not only failed to protect the rights of minorities, but in a number of cases actually actively assisted in violating those rights.

8119819,"Espressogb","Comment","","Federal grants-in-aid have played a crucial role in the expansion of federal authority. In a process dubbed ""Fiscal Federalism,"" the federal government uses its grants in order to broaden the scope of its authority. They can state where, when, and how those grants are to be used. If a state receives a grant for the betterment of its schools' facilities, it must be used for that purpose only. Furthermore states cannot raise their taxes too high without risking a substantial revenue loss, as taxpayers will move to a state which has lower tax rates. A notable example of the federal government trying to use grants-in-aid to influence state legislatures, is the tying of federal highway funds to the drinking age. If a state sets its drinking age lower than 21 years of age they risk losing 10% of their highway funds, which none are prepared to do.

The justification for their stipulations that always adhere to their grants-in-aid, is the fact that it is Congress's revenue and that they can dispose of it as they see fit.

In other countries, the postal service notifies the electoral collage of the change of address.

The professor asked for the difference between US and Europe but in other countries, like Chile, they changed the rules. Until the last presidential election, the system was: if you want to vote, you need to register but when you did, you must go to vote or you will be fined. The voting rates were 90% of the registers to vote. But since 2013, they changed the system to: automatic registration for 18 years old and older but it is not an obligation to vote. The results? Less than 50% of adults voted in the presidential election. It is important to mention, Election Day in Chile is always on Sunday.

Answering the second question, lower incomes and minorities are the most disadvantaged demographic groups because through the history, those groups didn't have the right to vote (until 1965) so for them, maybe participating in the voting process is not part of their traditions.

However, a majority of the Justices were of the opinion that the individual mandate did not fall under these powers.

Chief Justice Roberts would have held that the individual mandate lay outside Congress's Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clause powers, distinguishing the mandate from the federal prohibition on marijuana cultivation and possession upheld in Gonzales v. Raich in part on the ground that the latter regulated economic activity, while the individual mandate penalizes economic inactivity.
Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito would have held that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, for similar reasons.

If two or more people were tied for second on the list the Senate would choose among them the vice president. 

Today when an elector casts his ballot he lists one person as his choice for president and another as his choice for vice president. Then two separate lists are drawn up; one with all the names and votes cast for president, and another with all the names and votes cast for vice president. The person with a majority of votes on the presidential list is named president and the person with a majority of votes on the vice presidential list is named vice president.

The main difference between Presidential and Parliamentary System is the separation of power. In the presidential system, there are three separated institutions sharing power. In addition, there are different elections for electing the members of the executive and legislative branches that have to be controlled by different parties. By parliamentary system the legislative and executive power is hold by the same body. The two strongest individuals in this system are the “head of state” and “chief of executive”.

8119819,"Espressogb","Comment","","The reason that the ACA was under scrutiny for constitutionality, was whether or not it was allowed by the taxing clause or the commerce clause.

The pro- argument for the taxing clause is as follows. The financial penalty may reasonably be characterized as a tax. A tax such as this, under the constitution, is a right of Congress. Therefore it is not within our power to forbid it, or to pass [judgement] upon its wisdom or fairness. The con- argument for the taxing clause goes like this. The bill is worded as a penalty. Congress passed it as a penalty. There is no way in which to make that bill constitutional without taking it out of its original context. The court does not have the authority to reword any law that comes into question to make them fit the parameters of the constitution so that they can remain as a law. Therefore the law is unconstitutional.

Now for the commerce clause. The pro- argument goes like this. The uninsured, as a class, substantially affect interstate commerce. Those without insurance consume billions of dollars of health-care products and services each year. Those goods are produced, sold, and delivered largely by national and regional companies who routinely transact business across state lines. The uninsured also cross state lines to receive care. Therefore, their reasoning went, Congress can regulate it because it is a type of commerce. The con- argument is as follows. Congress does have the right to regulate commerce. But what it doesn't have, is the right to regulate commercial inactivity. If it had such a power, it could force individuals to engage in all sorts of behaviors, including buying healthy food instead of junk food.  Therefore the law is unconstitutional.

The court voted by a vote of 5 to 4, to uphold the law as a constitutional exercise of Congress's taxing power. 

Had been on the Supreme Court at the time of the ruling, these are the decisions that I would have come to concerning the clauses.

I would have come to the same conclusion concerning the commerce clause, but to a different one concerning the taxation clause. The statement that ""Congress has the power to regulate commercial activity, but not commercial inactivity,"" is one that I personally believe to be true. 

But, the court's decision to call the bill a tax is one that I disagree with. The bill was clearly intended to incur a penalty for noncooperation. It was not designated as a tax. 

Since we live in a capitalist society, which was founded upon capitalist ideals, the choice of whether or not to have a medical program is, I believe, up to the individual, not the current governing body who is just interested in the electorate and another term. 

Although this is probably not the opinion of everyone, it is mine. If you are of dissenting or concurring opinion, and would like to share it, please comment.

Then, compare the U.S. system of staggered and separate elections for House members, senators, and the president with a parliamentary system where all legislators are chosen in the same election. Which system provides voters greater influence over lawmakers?
The original system for electing federal officials, people were not permitted to vote for the President or for members of the Senate, they could only vote for the House representatives. 

“As originally written, the Constitution did not provide for the right to vote.
Some Americans were held in slavery and were denied even citizenship.
For their part, women were thought not to have
a rightful place in public affairs.
Not until ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920
did women get the right to vote.
The original Constitution had a single clause on voting.
It gave the states authority to determine voting eligibility
in federal elections, saying only that a state's restrictions on voting
could not be greater than those placed on voting for members of the largest
chamber of the state's legislature.”

Today, the Presidency, House and Senate are subject to the vote of the people who have two opportunities to vote, once in the primary, and once in the general election.

In European democracies, government assumes responsibility
for registering majority s.
If a citizen moves to a new address, for example,

The result is that over 90% of eligible European voters are registered.

8127948,"optimalteoh","Comment","","Federal officials of early America and of today are both elected by the people through direct and indirect means.

In early America, when Congress consisted only of the Senate, senators were appointed by state officials. Since state officials were elected by state residents, the senators were indirectly voted by the people. People would vote state officials who take care of their business and these state officials represent the population. Thus, appointed to Congress, the senators are appointed by state officials who do the bidding of the people and, theoretically, a state official would not appoint another individual who held a distinct set of beliefs into a position in the federal government representing the state.

Federal officials gradually expanded from, taking an instance from the legislature branch, the Senate to include the House of Representatives. Today, citizens have a direct vote for these members of congress. In addition, the people vote for electors to vote for the President in the Electoral College. Usually, electors vote for Presidents the people have voted them to vote.

In conclusion, in both the past and present, the American government has been a representative of the people through direct and indirect elections. The only difference is that, while representatives are elected through few steps in the early days and proportion of state populations was not taken into account in the earliest stage of history, the representative system today is a staggered one with federal officials being elected through comparatively more steps such as primary elections and general elections, to mention the most well known ones. Such system today is characteristic of the American democratic system and is a contrast with the parliamentary system of the UK and Malaysia, for example, a system that, based on the political atmospheres of the US and of Malaysia, hardly has any deficiency or advantage over the American system.","","",NA,"","2015-09-28 15:41:00","2015-09-28 15:41:00","False","","55e5fab49714b0b433000de8","56095fb001772bd721002529",2,0

But it’s also true that the spending of federal funds in general must comply with a series of rules which are mandatory even for the federal government, by example the annual budget.  Congress is entitled to assign funds, determining its application to concrete purposes like health, education, etc. A point of discussion could be the level of definition of the those purposes.

So originally the legislature was seen as the most powerful arm of government (it is described first in the Constitution) but, over time, both the Presidency and the Supreme Court (especially on social issues like desegregation, marriage and abortion) have assumed more power.This system of election means that a candidate can win the largest number of votes nationwide but fail to win the largest number of votes in the Electoral College and therefore fail to become President. The 'founding fathers' who drafted the American Constitution did not wish to give too much power to the people and so devised a system that gives the ultimate power of electing the President to members of the Electoral College. The same Constitution, however, enables each state to determine how its members in the Electoral College are chosen and since the 1820s states have chosen their electors by a direct vote of the people.

In parliamentary systems, the head of government is a prime minister selected from the parliament, and is typically the leader of the majority political party or coalition. The prime minister appoints a cabinet of ministers often consisting of other members of parliament. A separate head of state may be a monarch or an elected President (or comparable official). In the United States, the President is both head of government and head of state. The President is elected separately from the legislature and may or may not be of the legislature's majority political party.

8119819,"Espressogb","Comment","","It is stated within the Constitution that no man shall be deprived of ""life, liberty, or property,"" without ""due process."" Now what that intended, and how to enforce it, equally without bias, was a problem until the Supreme Court started the process of selective incorporation in 1925.

Selective incorporation is the process by which the Supreme Court has incorporated various rights over time into the Fourteenth Amendment. That process has gradually added those liberties to those that are protected directly by the Constitution.

It is up to the federal government to see that no one's rights are violated. It used to be up to the state and local government, but those institutions are more likely to violate your rights than the federal one is. Due to the fact that they have the primary responsibility of maintaining order.

The process of selective incorporation is important to the rights that Americans enjoy today for various reasons, but all of those reasons have to do with a right that had been violated. It protects the individual from unwarranted search and seizure. A person who has been arrested, if they can't afford one, has the right to an attorney, at the expense of the state. That person has the right to remain silent when questioned. 

This right became a federally regulated right after the case of Miranda v. Arizona, in which Miranda stated that he had confessed only because the police officers had not informed him that he had the right to remain silent, and he also had the right to an attorney. This case created the now familiar Miranda warning which police officers are now required to tell suspects at the time of their arrest, or face persecution. 

All of these are ""fundamental"" rights that all Americans have come to enjoy. Under federal jurisdiction, those rights are protected from abuse, by state and local governments. 

The reason that it is important, is that all Americans, no matter how poor, disadvantaged, or cheated that they may be, can be assured in the fact that these rights, will be preserved and protected at all costs.

Voting rates are lower in the United States than in Europe because we have had a history of voter disenfranchisement. Early on, there was a property requirement, then there was segregation that lead to the literacy tests and laws of the like to prevent African Americans from voting, and then there was gender inequality in voting until the 19th amendment. Now, politicians of the Republican and Democratic party argue over Voter ID laws and the process of Voter registration. The demographic groups most disadvantaged are the poor and those who are minorities. This is because they tend to either not be able to register to vote because of the tedious process, or because they do not have a government issued ID card, which is also a requirement to vote.

Normally, the states do not have enough money on their own and if they do, they would always want to accept money instead of spend their own, especially if they were going to follow the requirement of the grant in the first place. For example, if my state of Pennsylvania was going to build a high school, then it is obviously going to renovate a science lab. Instead of using PA residents' money for the lab, if they receive a federal grant to be used on the lab, they will use that and put the saved money elsewhere. There are quite a few justifications that enable Congress to determine how states can use the money. First of all, it is Congress's money, meaning that it will logically have the last word as to what should be done with it. Also, the Constitution gives Congress the power to tax/enforce laws that help the general welfare of the public, even if the subject area normally falls within state jurisdiction.

The legislatiors in the states or local governements can harm american civil liberties because the officials have the primary responsibility for policing and maintaining public order.

 the process of selective incorporation through the 14th Amendment help to incorporate some rights such as right of freedom of speech, right for an attorney settled in the Bill of rights.
 as the Chief Justice Marshall explicitly says the Bill of Rights only applies to the national government and the14th Amendment explicitly protects the ""privileges and immunities"" of U.S. citizens from state laws. ""Politically, the amendment was presented as a way of securing rights (particularly the rights to vote, speak, assemble and bear arms) for the recently emancipated slaves of the post-Civil War South"". 
Historically, in the 1920s, the Supreme Court dealing with many cases accepted that the Bill of Rights be a part as ""due process"" of law or the privileges and immunities of U.S. citizens. Little by little, the first 10 amendments were incorporated to restrict state governments. the 14th amendement has empowered the Supreme Court over the states to protect americans citizens.

Thus, it prohibits the state and local governments (which, in the main, have the primary responsibility for law enforcement and public safety) from denying their residents the due process of law.  However, the states still found ways around the amendment to evade vital tenets of sections of the amendment which were subjected to numerous litigations.  It was not until the U.S. supreme court began to pronounce rulings on cases relevant to the amendment that the provisions became clearer and the States, apparently reluctantly, began to observe the “rule of law” as it affected visible numbers of Americans’ rights.

Those supreme court judgements, majorly from 1925, determined and held that a ‘selected’ range of individual rights contained in the bill of rights are protected from action by state and local authorities.  It is this process – determining these judicial interpretations that has come to be known as selective incorporation.

Selective incorporation is a product of a convoluted path taken through the debate over incorporation of the Bill of Rights into the heart of the United States Constitution itself.

Following the passage of the 14th Amendment, the United States Supreme Court went through a series of judgments to properly weigh the value of an American's individual rights in congruence with the powers of the United States Federal Government. Over time, the result has slowly led to the incorporation of the Bill of Rights as a means to protect against states abusing their powers.","","",NA,"","2015-09-30 07:06:00","2015-09-30 07:06:00","False","","55e5fd7c9714b08e1a000e29","560b8a0a01772bf4e40027e4",2,0

While the people are free to make a living and engaging in social activities, involvement in activities that would endanger the lives of other individuals or the nation's well being are evidently not in sync with the Constitution. The Constitution seeks to provide the rights of the governed, yet it also provides for the security of the people and the well being of the nation. In the age of technology, organized and large scale terrorism has become a norm and it is also more globalized. If terrorists are utilizing technology to advance their agenda, it would be counter intelligent to forbid monitoring suspicious telephone and internet traffics. Besides, the US is a chief target for terrorism.

The NSA is very good as 1. it puts a security measure in place as provided by the Constitution (similar to police monitoring drug dealer suspects) and 2. it secures the privacy of law-abiding individuals, whereby access to the exact content of the information can only be made through the court (very much similar to acquiring a warrant to search a suspect in traditional criminal cases).

A popular argument against the NSA program is the invasion of privacy. As I argued above, such is not an issue and, thus, I find no basis to object to the NSA program. In fact, I give total support to this program.","","",NA,"","2015-09-30 07:55:00","2015-09-30 07:55:00","False","","55e5f9b09714b08e1a000e1f","560b95669714b06f3d00270d",2,0

Thus, it prohibits the state and local governments (which, in the main, have the primary responsibility for law enforcement and public safety) from denying their residents the due process of law.  However, the states still found ways around the amendment to evade vital tenets of sections of the amendment which were subjected to numerous litigations.  It was not until the U.S. supreme court began to pronounce rulings on cases relevant to the amendment that the provisions became clearer and the States, apparently reluctantly, began to observe the “rule of law” as it affected visible numbers of Americans’ rights.

Those supreme court judgements, majorly from 1925, determined and held that a ‘selected’ range of individual rights contained in the bill of rights are protected from action by state and local authorities.

The U.S. system of staggering elections for various offices, which includes holding primary elections for the choosing of candidates for those offices, allows for more influence over lawmakers than does the Parliamentary system that holds one election for all offices at once.  Parliamentary candidates are chosen by their parties, and primary elections are not held.  In the U.S. system, even presidential candidates chosen through their parties must be vetted by voters in primary elections and caucuses of party members.  In California, voters are even allowed to vote for candidates using a primary ballot for a party to which they do not officially belong.  In such cases, voters have an especially influential voice.

The way it is passed into law in the US, the middle class has a disincentive to seek care at early stages of illness, yet preventive health measures are a way to keep the cost of health care down. Working class in Europe is guaranteed basic health care, even if living paycheck to paycheck.  The fact that in 1970s, there was a need to pass laws that require health care providers to take care of anyone with a medical emergency due to the fact that there was ""much experience of sick and injured people being left on streets or dumped somewhere where they got no care"" questions the morality of the society as a whole.

According to the lecture video, selective incorporation is when the US Supreme court selectively incorporates bits and pieces of the Bill of Right through the 14th Amendment.

As an example is the Gideon case  as a selective incorporation: 6th Amendment (rights to an attorney, 14th Amendment (right to protection against state action) and the state must provide attorney to poor defendant.

The selective incorporation is very important to the rights Americans enjoy today because it gives the fundamental rights to live in the States of America in a democratical country especially in a 6th Amendment (a fair trial), in 4th Amendment e.g. search and seizure- the right of the People to be secure in their homes, papers, effects against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated. Excusionary rule cannot ordinarily be used against the accused during a trial. The judge not the Police can decide whether the evidence was sufficient to allow the search.

2809579,"ArslanBaig","Comment","","The original Constitution provided for election by popular vote of House members only. Senators were chosen by the state legislatures and the president was chosen by electors (each state having as many electors as it has members in Congress). 

Senators are now chosen by popular vote, a change that occurred in 1913 through a constitutional amendment. The president is still chosen by electors, but voters have a direct voice in the process because states now tie their electoral votes to their popular vote outcomes. By winning a state’s popular vote, a presidential candidate also wins its electoral votes. This change came about in the early 1800s. 

As a means of guarding against majority tyranny, the framers of the Constitution staggered the terms of office of federal officials. House members would be elected to a two-year term, the president to a four-year term, and senators to a six-year term (a third of the senators chosen every two years). The thinking behind this arrangement is that it would make it difficult for an unreasoning majority to capture full power in a single election. The time between one election and the next one might be sufficient for that majority to come to its senses.

The U.S. system differs from a parliamentary system in which all elected officials are elected at the same time and for the same term of office. A parliamentary system is a more direct form of majority rule. In a single election, a voting majority can determine in full who will be in power—not only in the legislature but in the executive. The prime minister, chosen by the majority party, is head of the legislature as well as being chief executive.

In the U.S. system, majority rule is more difficult to achieve. The president, senators, and House members are all separately elected and to different terms of office, and power is divided between the executive and legislative branches. At times, power has been split between the political parties, with one party controlling one or both houses of Congress and the other party controlling the presidency.","","",NA,"","2015-10-03 12:20:00","2015-10-03 12:20:00","False","","55e5fa6201772bc852000dac","560fc7f09714b0e00a002b4a",2,0
2809579,"ArslanBaig","Comment","","There are a number of reasons why U.S. voting rates are lower than those in Europe. One reason is that Election Day in many European countries is a holiday or takes place on a weekend; this timing is designed to make it easy for people to get to the polls. In contrast, U.S. elections are held on a Tuesday, which is a day when most people are at work.

The major reason for the difference, however, is voter registration. Among registered voters only, the voting rate in the U.S. is roughly equal to that in Europe. However, the overall voting rate in the U.S. is lower because it has a much higher percentage of unregistered voters; such citizens are not allowed to vote.

In most European democracies, government takes responsibility for registration. If an eligible voter moves to a new address, the postal service will notify registration officials, who will update the individual’s registration. As a result, over 90 percent of eligible voters in Europe are registered to vote. In contrast, registration in the United States is the individual’s responsibility. Eligible citizens have to take the initiative in order to register. That’s not always easy to do. In some states, it can require locating and traveling to a registration office during working hours and being able to show clear proof of citizenship. Only about 75 percent of eligible Americans are registered to vote. 

The groups most disadvantaged by the U.S. system are those that are poor and have minimal schooling. Such individuals are less likely to have a driver’s license or passport or have on hand a certified copy of their birth certificate, which some states require as proof of citizenship as a condition of registration. Such individuals are also less likely to have the transportation necessary to travel to a registration office. In addition, they are less likely to know where to go to register, and when. And they are more likely to change residency; a change of residency requires an individual to re-register. For such reasons, voter registration in the United States is substantially lower among those of lower income and education than among those with higher income and education.

2809579,"ArslanBaig","Comment","","The Constitution “reserves” to the states the power to decide policy in areas such as health, education, and welfare. Accordingly, the federal government does not have the power to dictate, for example, how states will operate their public schools. However, the Supreme Court has held that Congress can tax and spend to promote “the general welfare.” That authority has allowed Congress to establish grants-in-aid programs to the states in areas such as health, education, and welfare. States are not compelled to accept such grants. But, if they take a federal grant, they are bound by the spending conditions attached to the money. For example, a federal grant aimed at providing free lunch to children of lower-income families cannot be used to raise teachers’ salaries. Federal grants now account for about a fifth of the budgets of state governments, meaning that a significant part of their policy activity is conducted within the context of rules set down by the federal government through its grants-in-aid.

The justification for allowing Congress to set the conditions for federal grants to states is the simple fact that the money is raised by the federal government and can be spent as Congress sees fit. It is not the states’ money but rather money granted to them by Congress. If states could somehow dictate to Congress the terms of federal grants, they would be intruding on a power granted to Congress by the U.S. Constitution, which would violate the Constitution’s supremacy clause (which says that state law cannot infringe on valid federal authority).","","",NA,"","2015-10-03 12:22:00","2015-10-03 12:22:00","False","","55e5fbf89714b09e52000df6","560fc8959714b01cf2000df5",2,0
2809579,"ArslanBaig","Comment","","The Sebelius case arose when roughly two dozen states challenged the provision of the 2010 Affordable Care Act that requires individuals to acquire health insurance or pay a penalty when they file their taxes. 

In terms of the commerce clause, the pro argument was that health care is a component of interstate commerce, which is within the power of Congress to regulate. Proponents argued that individuals without health insurance place a burden on interstate commerce. When they get sick, they go to an emergency room for treatment but are unable to pay the bill. That cost then gets passed along to others, raising the cost of their insurance and burdening commerce. Opponents of this argument conceded that Congress has the power to regulate commerce but argued that the individual insurance mandate penalizes people for not engaging in commerce, which is not within Congress’s commerce power. If Congress had that power, they argued, it could compel people to engage in all sorts of activities, forcing them, for example, to eat healthy foods rather than junk foods. In its ruling, the Supreme Court divided 5-4 in favor of the argument that the commerce clause does not empower Congress to force people to engage in a commercial activity.

The Supreme Court also divided 5-4 on whether the taxing clause of the Constitution permits Congress to impose a penalty on those who fail to obtain health insurance. In this case, the Court’s majority sided with Congress, saying that the penalty was effectively a tax on individuals who don’t obtain insurance and, as a tax, is within Congress’s authority. Opponents of this argument pointed out that both President Obama, who pushed for enactment of the health care reform law, and the Democratic majority in Congress that passed it into law, refrained from calling the penalty a “tax.” They repeatedly referred to it as a “penalty.” Reasoning from this fact, opponents of the law said that Congress’s intended the penalty as a penalty and not as a tax, and that it was therefore inaccurate to interpret as a valid act under Congress’s taxing power.","","",NA,"","2015-10-03 12:23:00","2015-10-03 12:23:00","False","","55e5fc969714b01c9d000e1f","560fc8dc01772bd5110029b6",2,0
2809579,"ArslanBaig","Comment","","Selective incorporation is the process whereby the Supreme Court, through use of the 14th Amendment, has protected most of the rights in the Bill of Rights from action by state and local governments. When it was enacted, the Bill of Rights applied only to action by the federal government. Thus, for example, Congress was prohibited by the First Amendment for infringing on free speech but state and local governments were not. Today, they are prohibited from doing so, and the reason is selective incorporation through the 14th Amendment.

Ratified in the aftermath of the Civil War, the 14th Amendment prohibits state governments (and local governments, which are agents of the states) from denying their residents “due process” of law. The 14th Amendment does not specify what is covered by “due process.” Starting in 1925, the Supreme Court in a series of rulings made that determination, holding that a range of individual rights contained in the Bill of Rights are protected from action by state and local governments. 

This process, whereby specific rights contained in the Bill of Rights are extended to the state and local governments, is called selective incorporation. It is selective because only particular rights in the Bill of Rights are given protection. And it’s called incorporation because the process involves incorporating (or bringing) into the 14th Amendment some of the rights contained in the Bill of Rights, thus protecting them from state or local action.

The Gideon case, which was discussed in the lecture, provides an example. In that case, the 6th Amendment right to an attorney—which applies in federal court cases—was incorporated into the 14th Amendment, thereby extending the right to an attorney to cases heard in state and local courts.

Selective incorporation has been extraordinarily important in securing Americans’ rights. In the U.S. system, state and local governments have primary responsibility for law enforcement and public safety, which are the activities where authorities are most likely to intrude on individuals’ rights. Because of selective incorporation, state and local officials are obligated to respect their residents’ constitutional rights.","","",NA,"","2015-10-03 12:25:00","2015-10-03 12:25:00","False","","55e5fd599714b0069b000e5f","560fc9409714b08e06002c3d",2,0

7707463,"KarinaMartucci","Comment","","What role have federal grants-in-aid played in the expansion of federal authority? What is the justification for allowing Congress to determine how states and localities can use federal grants-in-aid?

As the other studenst have explained “The federal aid system is a roundabout way to fund state and local activities that serves no important economic or practical purpose. The system has many widely-recognized failings but a web of special interest groups block reforms. Those groups include the hundreds of trade associations that represent the recipients of federal aid and the millions of state and local employees that depend on federal aid to pay their salaries.”

Said Prof. Patterson, the vast majority are sought out by the states,
because they allow them to provide better services than they
could provide on their own.
Each year, for instance, the federal government
gives states and localities roughly $40 billion,
to improve their roads and highways.
Now let's look at what we've said.
As we noted, the US Constitution created a federal system of government.
The first of its kind in the world.
It divided sovereignty between a national government and state
governments.
The Constitution itself speaks to the powers of the national government.
The powers it does not address are reserved to the states.
Over time, the national government has taken
on additional policy responsibilities.
And that change has been accompanied by changes in constitutional doctrine.
The Supreme Court has concluded that, the necessary and proper clause
is a broad grant of power to the national government.
That the commerce clause allows for substantial federal regulation
of the economy, and that Congress's taxing and spending power
can be used to promote the general welfare.
The last of these interpretations has allowed Washington,
through grants and aid, to exert influence in a range of policy areas,
traditionally within control of the states,
including education, health and welfare.
The net result has been a nationalization of the federal system.
Overtime, power in America has shifted from the states,
to the government in Washington.

7707463,"KarinaMartucci","Comment","","What is the process of selective incorporation, and why is it important to the rights Americans enjoy today?

""
It is ""selective"" because only particular rights in the Bill of Rights
are given protection.
And it's called ""incorporation"" because the process involves
incorporating, or bringing into the 14th Amendment, rights
that are contained in the Bill of Rights,
thus protecting them from state action.
In the Gideon case, for example, the Sixth Amendment right to an attorney,
which protects citizens from action by the federal government,
was incorporated into the 14th Amendment,
thereby extending the right to an attorney
to cases involving state and local governments.
Selective incorporation is one of the most important developments
in the history of American civil liberties.
Think about it for a minute.
Which level of government is more likely to violate your rights?
Is it the federal government?
Or is it state and local governments?
Although many Americans are more distrustful of the federal government,
the state and local governments are actually
more likely to intrude on people's rights.
Well over 95% of the court cases alleging
a violation of constitutional rights originate with these governments.
The major reason is that these officials have primary responsibility
for policing and for maintaining public order, precisely the situations
where citizens are most likely to come into conflict with authorities.
You ever been stopped by a federal officer, such as an FBI agent?
Probably not.
Not many Americans have.
Have you ever been stopped by local police officer or the state highway
patrol?
Well, if you drive a car or hang out on city streets,
there's a good chance you have.
That's why the 14th Amendment and the Supreme Court's application of it
to the actions of the states and localities
has been so key in protecting Americans' rights.
In the rest of the session, we'll explain
some of the individual rights protected by the US Constitution
and describe what they mean in practice.
We'll concentrate on the two areas that have received the most
attention from the Supreme Court-- Americans' political expression
rights and their fair trial rights.
In later sessions of the course, we'll examine rights
not in these two areas, particularly freedom of religion,
which has been the subject of a number of key court decisions;
the right to bear arms, which the Supreme Court recently
decided includes handgun ownership; and the right
of privacy, which applies, for example, to issues
of abortion and same-sex relations.
Let me note at the outset that no right is absolute.
Rights can be limited, for instance, if they cause harm to others.
You have a right to free speech, but not to tell malicious lies that
destroy another person's reputation.
You could plead the First Amendment if you did that,
but it wouldn't get you very far.
You'd be found guilty of slander and ordered
to pay for the damage caused to the person's reputation.

7797094,"AkeemAdekunbi","Comment","","The Federal has been using grants-in-aid to expand its authority. For instance, during Ronald Reagan's Presidency, the national government successfully used the grants-in-aid to set the national drinking age at 21 claiming that the fatalities from alcohol related traffic accidents involving young drivers were too high. In order to achieve this, the Congress passed a law, saying that states that did not set drinking age at 21 would lose 10% of their Federal Highway fund. When this was challenged, the Supreme Court ruled that the Federal Government had  successfully exercised its constitutional spending powers to provide for general welfare.  

The federal grants to states and local governments continue to grow. President Obama's 2016 budget request estimates show that the total outlays for federal grants to the regional governments will be USD628.2 billion in 2015, USD651.7 billion in 2016, and USD678.1 billion in 2017. With these growths in federal spending one would naturally expect a growth in federal authority.

The combined effect of the constitutional clauses that grant federal government power to provide for general welfare and to tax and spend has always been the justification for allowing the Congress to determine how states can use federal grants-in-aid.

The difference is how they are arranged and managed. France has similar political culture as the United States but has not been able to maintain a stable government. They transition from one regiment  to another.
Many Latin-American governments were created taking America’s culture as a model and many had fallen into dictatorships, in my opinion, because the government and the people beliefs are not share at the same levels. People in these countries are not politically involved.
The participation of the Americans in politics goes according to education levels, race and gender although everyone is invited to participate , especially in regards to voting.

In the European countries the government is responsible for registering voters. They even follow them when they move to make sure everybody has the same chance of voting. In America everyday things are more difficult; it is the citizens' responsibility to register , there are many regulations and not enough information. Now with the era of the internet people assume that everyone has access to the net and or are savvy users. People with low income have trouble registering because it is not free or they have to transport themselves to a place to register. Regarding voting is the same problem for elders, new immigrant citizens and minorities.

A major criterion, possibly the most important one, is whether voters actually control elections and their legislative consequences.
Can voters decide who runs for office and set the priorities for the legislation their elected representatives pass if they are elected?
Can voters freely run their own candidates? Or must they vote for candidate run by intermediaries like political parties or special interests?

Voter identification laws have become increasingly common in states, even though previous literature suggests that making the voting process more difficult results in decreases in turnout on both the individual and aggregate levels. Opponents of identification laws suggest that they could disadvantage certain segments of the population, particularly the poor, racial minorities, the young, and the elderly. I test these claims using individual-level data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) of recent primary and general elections. I find little evidence to support the claims that identification law detractors make. While progressively strict identification laws do cause some turnout decreases, these decreases are not significantly larger for minorities and the poor than they are for whites and more wealthy people. There are some very slight differential effects among the young and the elderly. Overall, claims that voter identification laws place outsize burdens to certain demographic groups seem to be exaggerated.

6591688,"Josu015","Comment","","American constitutional history includes the incorporation of constitutional guarantees of the Bill of Rights by incorporating
selective. The selective incorporation has been accepted by the majority of judges as judicial decrees of the Supreme Court.

The Gitlow case is the origin of the constitutional process of ""selective inclusion"". According to the Supreme Court, through ""selective incorporation"", the meaning and limitations of the National Charter of Rights to the states and local governments are imposed. The words of the fourteenth amendment are:
No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or inminidades of citizens of the United States; or deprive any person of life, their liberty or property without due process.

After Gitlow case, most plaintiffs asked override state convictions for similar errors right, they incurred some state courts. They based their arguments on the false belief that the error was of such constitutional right proportions involving the revocation of the decision. From 1932 until today, the Supreme Court has incorporated gradually, case by case, almost all the rights of the Charter of Rights.

Adherents to ""selective incorporation 'rights argue that some but not all of the Bill of Rights should be incorporated in the sense of ensuring due process clause. The rights that may be included are fundamental and necessary to maintain ""freedom and order"" in a civilized society.

This is critical for American citizens and as it is more probable to be state officials or local government to limit their, that the Federal Government civil rights. And with the selective incorporation, States and local governments are forced to comply with legles guarantees, procedural Constitution dictates.","","",NA,"","2015-10-06 16:13:00","2015-10-06 16:13:00","False","","55e5fd599714b0069b000e5f","5613f30c9714b06f3d002eef",2,0

1332332,"Stoikata","Comment","","This process, whereby rights contained in the Bill of Rights are extended to the state governments by the 14th Amendment, is called ""selective incorporation."" For example the First amendment holds that ""Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech, the press,"". It is explicitly said that obligation is for the Congress, which mean the obligation is for the Federal government.  But the USA Supreme court in cluster of decisions, interpreted the 14 Amendment, according to which ""no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law"" and began to say what was meant by life, liberty, or property. 
In 1925, in its ruling Gitlow, the Supreme Court held that state governments are not completely free to decide for themselves what their residents may legally say.  In that way the Supreme court said directly that the 14th Amendment's due process clause  protects free speech from action by the states. After this decision, the court started one by one to incorporate the rights, that are contained in the Bill of right,  in the 14 Amendment clause. In the Gideon case, for example, the Sixth Amendment right to an attorney, was incorporated into the 14th Amendment. Wit this selective incorporation the Supreme court extending the right to an attorney to cases involving state and local governments.

People are voting for different parties, after that are created majority in the parliament who decides composition of executive staff (prime minister, head and deputy heads of ministries, head of national bank and all other parliamentary and executive agencies and affiliated structures) and majority decide also the candidature of President of the country. This kind of elections could be dangerous, because if one party will took majority (and the history already showed us this possibility exist), government could decide almost all during the next 4 year, and this create an 'soviet' type of government - when during the elections, people have one single candidate :).
From the perspective of US model o elections is much more better 'weighted', because the elections for Congress are not made in parallel with House of Representative, and between this 2 elections period population could change their opinion regarding one party or other, period much shorter then in parliamentary elections (which could not be done in regular parliamentary republics, when this mercerize could be done once in 4 years). On the other hand each 2 years elections + voting for presidency, for some people create continue elections - which could be for somebody tiresome and costly for government.

This practice also allows for dangerous deficits, which can burden posterity and jeopardize the financial stability of the Treasury and our economy.
Congress can provide money for states under the necessary and proper clause of the Constitution. They can control public policy by requiring that the money be spent with certain conditions, without technically compelling the states to perform the function. However, the recent Supreme Court case involving the Affordable Care Act has been praised by conservatives by limiting the scope of grants-in-aid, requiring that the states be given a true choice in the expansion of Medicaid.

For the commerce clause, the health insurance industry is a large sector of the national economy and has a tremendous impact on the cost of healthcare, so it can be seen as a legitimate regulation of interstate commerce. However, insurance is already highly regulated by the states, having very little influence across state lines. Also, regulating economic inactivity has never been seen as a practice of the federal government.

These early methods were established by framers who wanted to limit the influence of popular opinion on the government and protect the U.S  from the passions of the majority.  Through indirect elections of the Senate and the President, nomination of candidates through party organizations and and even the use of a restrictive formula for determining the number of  Representatives each state could elect, the framers cushioned the government from the pressuring influence of its citizens and blunted the effect of a popular majority seeking power. Subsequent changes to these methods occurred after challenges to the Constitution were presented and amendments were added. These changes resulted in the development of political parties, which united leaders and linked them in ideology with majorities; direct elections of Senators  and popular election of the president (via the electoral college) which gave stronger representation of the actual will of the people over elected officials; and the amendments affecting the formula for voter eligibility (15th and 19th amendments), establishing the recognition of the rights of all citizens to vote and creating a truly representative government.","","",NA,"","2015-10-12 17:04:00","2015-10-12 17:04:00","False","","55e5fa6201772bc852000dac","561be80ec76277d2a800025e",2,0
6082815,"ncdoy2009","Comment","","While a majority of Americans believe voting is an essential obligation of citizenship, voter turnout has declined since the 1960's (in Presidential elections) and ranks near the bottom of the world's democracies; the turnout average for U.S. Presidential elections is around 55%. The voter registration process relies on the individual and is not automatically processed by the government, as it is in most other democracies. Presidential and other official elections occur during the working week (think: Super Tuesday), which can be inconvenient for employed citizens or students. The absence of a labor party, which could bring lower income workers to the polls, may reduce voter turnout.  Frequent elections and lack of distinct differences between the parties may also contribute to low turnout (those party difference may have become more distinct over the past administration).

Registration requirements, including voter ID laws, can disproportionately inhibit voting rates of the poor, minorities and the elderly. The process of procuring a state issued, photo identification, required by states with the most restrictive laws, can be a burden to those with the least resources. Getting to the voting station can present a challenge to the poor. The south has more poverty and a tradition of more restrictive registration laws (originally intended to prevent black people from voting); thus turnout is lower than in the north.  Establishing legal residency can pose a problem for immigrants and can create a barrier to voting, affecting the voter turnout of the Latino community.","","",NA,"","2015-10-12 19:54:00","2015-10-12 19:54:00","False","","55e5fb5c9714b07ea7000db4","561c0fe1d2aca52a56000298",2,0

As others have stated above, a government cannot force an individual to participate in an economic eactivity, even if it creates a bigger burden for the government. The argument, from my undersanding, was made that an individual mandate is lawful due to taxation. If someone goes to the hospital and cannot afford to pay it, then this fee has to be paid by someone else; thust a burden on the government. But is this not the same as people who cannot afford Obamacare getting help with ""affording"" it? Let alone the quality of the product.

It is quiet surprising because the first thought about U.S. is that the citizens are absolutely aware of their rights and they are not afraid to use them. Not exactly the same about Italy and even so the voting rates are higher. One reason can be that voting participation restrictions existed not so long ago and can be affective still to the recent voting behavior. The lack of various parties can be also a reason. The strict voting requirements like government-issued photo ID in certain states are obviously a barrier for those who can't afford it. Mostly the elderly and undergraduated groups and minorities are affected. The self-responsible registration is another problem, however the Motor Voter Act has improved the situation.

The House of Representatives was elected by the people, however, the Senate was elected by each state legislature.  All men were allowed to vote due to the 13th amendment which was put into effect after the Civil War.  Later in the 19th Amendment women were allowed the right to vote after many years of struggle and protesting.  The Southern States made it difficult for African Americans to vote using the White Primary, literacy tests and poll taxes, all of which were slowly done away with.  

The Federal Legislature was given a short 2 year term because it was thought that if the people unwisely voted on a representative who was a smooth talker or someone who turned out to be unsuitable they would be able to elect a different person the next time.  Senators were given a longer term of six years because they were assumed to be the upper, more well educated people who would and could take the time to slowly consider and ponder on laws passed and slow down the passions of the Legislature.  The President would serve a term of 4 years.  

Part of the reason for staggered numbers of terms was so that the complete government could not be changed at once by the people.

6737792,"Juan_Ca","Comment","","Good morning,

I think that the voting rates in the United States are lower than in Europe because voters in the United States have to register, i.e. registration is the individual’s responsibility. In contrast, in Europe government registers voters.

The demographic groups most disadvantaged by U.S. voting laws are the bottom income voters. The reason is that in the United States, generally, who vote are the higher income voters. In addition, there is a relationship between the economic status and the party preference. Higher income voters tend to vote the Republican Party and bottom income voters tend to vote the Democratic Party. 

So, the Democratic Party tries to make voter registration easier in order that most of bottom income voters can vote for this party. In contrast, the Republican Party is not interested in making the voter registration easier and, in this sense, there can be mentioned the voter ID laws enacted by the Republican-controlled legislatures of Georgia and Indiana. These voter ID laws, although they try to prevent voter fraud, in fact difficult to register for citizens without a formal ID, most of whom are bottom incomes voters and minorities.

In my opinion, the federal grants-in-aid have played an important role in the expansion of federal authority. According to the interpretation of the Supreme Court about the taxing and spending clause, the Congress’s power to tax and spend can be used to promote the general welfare, so that, in particular, through grants and aid, the federal government has expanded its influence in policy areas traditionally reserved for the states, such as education, health and welfare.  

States can participate in federal grant programs or can refuse these programs. But if a state accepts a federal grant, the state have to observe the federal requirements for its use.

In this sense, the justification for allowing Congress to determine how states can use federal grants-in-aid is that the money is granted by Congress, and Congress has the constitutional authority to specify how that money can be spent by states.

This process is important to the rights Americans enjoy today because the most court cases alleging a violation of constitutional rights originate with local and state governments, and the extension of the guarantees in the Bill of Rights into the 14th Amendment to the actions of to the state and local governments is essential to protect citizens from the state and local actions.

It is in secret, dark places that behavior goes aberrant. We all know that in our own lives, but with us, the ramifications of our aberrance are short reaching in our little circles. At the level of national government however, secret committees and secret judicial actions seem quite against principle, and could have detrimental effects that are deep and far reaching.

Understanding the concerns of national security with regard to terrorist cells activating on US soil, it would be shortsighted to take away tools that those charged with our protection need in order to do their jobs well. But it seems to me that a way could be found to move ahead with the program without violating core principles that we know can, and likely will, lead to scandalous and damaging misuse. Limiting government does not mean castrating it, but it does mean leaving it open to the full light of day. Monitoring communications for terrorist patterns seems a good idea, but secret judicial committees seem not only unnecessary and un-American, but also simply unwise.

If the NSA fears that oversight would compromise their ability to use any relevant information that their program might uncover in a timely manner, maybe there is a way to satisfy that concern, and the concerns about secret, shadowy committees at the same time. Likely, partisanship prevents that granular of cooperation and deliberation from proceeding, but it is what I believe should happen none-the-less.","","",NA,"","2015-10-19 12:40:00","2015-10-19 12:40:00","False","","55e5f9b09714b08e1a000e1f","5624e4c3d2aca5e4f1000a04",2,0

8633960,"dragnetmarketing1","Comment","","Originally, voters were kept out of the election process, ostensibly for the reason that the Rhode Island incident suggests; a tyranny of the majority, which was also what happened in the French Revolution and eventually lead to, or at least contributed to the terror. Considering the history of the influential vs the not so influential states, and the solution of the bifurcated congress, it seems as though having any populace representation at all was an afterthought and a stroke of good fortune. And wresting power away from the State Legislatures in the area of senatorial election also seems like a near whim, and only succeeded because enough non-career senators got in, and were still new enough and uncorrupted enough to allow the populace more influence in that area. 

Considering these points, and the additional factor that the electoral college now includes a provision that at least nods toward voter expression, we seem to have made some adjustments which give voter preference more sway, but it still seems that the general population is very far removed from legislative influence, or even from influencing presidential elections on a national scale. The current system seems more of a patronization and pacification than any real allowance of public practical influence, especially considering the skill with which parties manipulate the machine. If I had to choose, I guess I have to say that the current system allows more influence by the public, but maybe the comparison is not apples to apples. And the influence of modern voters may be nothing more than a mollification and an illusion.","","",NA,"","2015-10-19 15:21:00","2015-10-19 15:21:00","False","","55e5fab49714b0b433000de8","56250a699c2aeea9570001f5",2,0

6082815,"ncdoy2009","Comment","","The relationship between the states and the national government began to change in the 1930's following the introduction of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, programs from which were comprised of economic recovery legislation designed to alleviate the suffering of Americans after the Great Depression. The Great Depression, thus, exposed the economic interdependence between the nation and the states and the frail nature of the national economy when subjected to its' uncontained and catastrophic effects.  Following the recognition and actuation of this interdependence was the trend of expansion of national authority; national government began to play a significant role in policy area which before were exclusively controlled by state and local governments.  Growth of this trend could be traced to Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society program, during which initiatives in health care, public housing, nutrition, welfare and urban development were enacted. Because the amount of taxes collected by the federal government were inherently greater than those collected by the individual states, the revenue raised at the national level allowed the federal government to support programs which states and localities might not have afforded; this fiscal federalism formed the basis of the economic relationship between federal and state/local governments. Federal funds facilitated programs at the local level (grants-in-aid) and naturally resulted in increasing federal authority and influence over policy decisions.  This aid could be turned down, but if accepted, Congress specified the way in which it was spent.  Along with this acceptance came the ability to accomplish local interest goals and offer services previously unaffordable.   It also placed states in the position of supporting and accomplishing national policy priorities.","","",NA,"","2015-10-22 00:05:00","2015-10-22 00:05:00","False","","55e5fbf89714b09e52000df6","562828419c2aee70390003cb",2,0

8656044,"MisterJeff","Comment","","Voters today have a more direct voice in the election system as compared to the original system.  The switch from having senators appointed by state legislatures to direct election by the people has helped voters have more direct control over who represents them.  Before, the appointment of senators had, in some cases, become a corrupt process where senators were determined based on political favors.

The electoral collage as well is now more in line with the voice of the people.  The electors now vote according to the popular vote in their state whereas before they were free to vote however they wanted.  This too has increased the people's voice.

There is a mixed answer to which system, the US or a parliamentary system, provides the voters a greater influence over lawmakers.  The US system allows for more direct votes of representatives, but the greater number of separate elections tends to result in lower voter turnout.  Therefore, while theoretically the US system would allow for greater influence over lawmakers, it actuality the parliamentary system, with its fewer elections with greater participation, allows the people to have more influence over its lawmakers.","","",NA,"","2015-10-24 22:23:00","2015-10-24 22:23:00","False","","55e5fa6201772bc852000dac","562c04d2c762772923000b5e",2,0

7089566,"VICTORCAM","Comment","","There are a number of reasons why U.S. voting rates are lower than those in Europe. One reason is that Election Day in many European countries is a holiday or takes place on a weekend; this timing is designed to make it easy for people to get to the polls. In contrast, U.S. elections are held on a Tuesday, which is a day when most people are at work.

The major reason for the difference, however, is voter registration. Among registered voters only, the voting rate in the U.S. is roughly equal to that in Europe. However, the overall voting rate in the U.S. is lower because it has a much higher percentage of unregistered voters; such citizens are not allowed to vote.

In most European democracies, government takes responsibility for registration. If an eligible voter moves to a new address, the postal service will notify registration officials, who will update the individual’s registration. As a result, over 90 percent of eligible voters in Europe are registered to vote. In contrast, registration in the United States is the individual’s responsibility. Eligible citizens have to take the initiative in order to register. That’s not always easy to do. In some states, it can require locating and traveling to a registration office during working hours and being able to show clear proof of citizenship. Only about 75 percent of eligible Americans are registered to vote. 

The groups most disadvantaged by the U.S. system are those that are poor and have minimal schooling. Such individuals are less likely to have a driver’s license or passport or have on hand a certified copy of their birth certificate, which some states require as proof of citizenship as a condition of registration. Such individuals are also less likely to have the transportation necessary to travel to a registration office. In addition, they are less likely to know where to go to register, and when. And they are more likely to change residency; a change of residency requires an individual to reregister. For such reasons, voter registration in the United States is substantially lower among those of lower income and education than among those with higher income and education.

The requirement that individuals pay a penalty for not obtaining health insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax; the Constitution does not guarantee that individuals my avoid taxation through inactivity; Congress has increased taxes on those who have a certain amount of income but who choose to go without health insurance - such legislation is within Congress's power to tax. Con-arguments regarding the taxing clause include: reclassifying the individual mandate as a tax rather than a penalty in order to sustain its constitutionality was not to interpret the statute but to rewrite it, a troubling exercise of judicial power; the Constitution requires tax increases to originate in the House of Representatives per the Origination Clause (Article 1, Section 7, clause 1).

Pro-arguments regarding the Commerce Clause include: the individual mandate is upheld because Congress had a rational basis for concluding that the uninsured, as a class, substantially affect interstate commerce; those without insurance consume billions of dollars of health care products and services each year; those goods are produced, sold, and delivered by national and routinely transact business across state lines; the uninsured also cross state lines to receive care. Con-arguments regarding the Commerce Clause include: the individual mandate lay outside of Congress's Commerce Clause ( and Necessary and Proper Clause) powers because the mandate penalizes economic inactivity as opposed to regulating economic activity; Congress's power does not extend to the regulation of economic inactivity; the Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to regulate interstate commerce, not to order individuals to engage in it, thus the individual mandate cannot be upheld as an exercise of Congress's power; the individual mandate threatens the constitutional order because it gives such an expansive meaning to the Commerce Clause that all private conduct (including failure to act) becomes subject to federal control, effectively destroying the Constitution's division of powers.

It is clear the Supreme court was well aware of the future ramifications of of its ruling on this very complex and controversial case. The array of explanations, justifications and dissents surrounding this case illustrate the multifaceted nature of this mandate. Does the enforcement of his mandate fulfill the purpose for which it was intended? Does the penalty of inactivity promote action, or does it create a burden on a citizenry already bearing the financial hardship and enduring the substantial risk of being without insurance? For some individuals, the mandate is considerably less penalizing than insurance premiums; however, is it fair to expect others to bear the cost of covering that uninsured individual's healthcare costs via increased premiums and medical costs? Does the revenue generated from collected mandates alleviate the national costs associated with uninsured hospitalizations? Does approving this mandate set a precedent for other mandates of non-participation, such as failure to participate in savings plan for retirement or long term health care? Is the mandate a subsidy, and will a citizen receive a portion of the subsidy back as a discount on taxes or premiums if he does buy health insurance?","","",NA,"","2015-10-27 03:46:00","2015-10-27 03:46:00","False","","55e5fc969714b01c9d000e1f","562ef3b0d2aca52a56000fc8",2,0

The presidential system was broadened by the strange Amendment XII of 1804 which set up a separate electoral system.  In this scheme, a temporary organization which supposedly reflected the population of the individual state and specifically limited to that one responsibility - choses the president.  Beginning in the presidential election of 1824, a direct vote was added.  In four occasions since, the US president was elected by someone other than the people.  In 1824 it was the House of Representatives who chose the conservative John Quincy Adams even though Andrew Jackson got both the electoral and the popular majority. In 2000 it was the Supreme Court that chose the conservative G.W. Bush, even though Al Gore got both the popular and electoral majority.

Additionally by requiring voting in person, often at inconvenient voting places, sometimes with long lines - instead of using the more convenient surface mail or even electronic balloting and scheduling voting during the working week instead of weekends, voting is made even less convenient.   Our heavily politicized government has also returned to unnecessary voting laws in the name of eliminating virtually non-existent voter fraud by popularizing more stringent voting laws such as requiring photo ID identification.   This is a clearly partisan move sanctioned by the US Supreme Court – despite Amendment XIV which says that “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the US” as well as Amendment XXIV which prohibits interfering with the right of citizens to vote, such as poll taxes.  Minorities, recent immigrants and disadvantaged people are more dependent on government and tend to vote Democratic, and it has been pretty well shown these restrictions on voting affects these classes more than it does the more mobile, more monetarily hefty Republicans.   I also have the feeling that many Americans believe politics is a dirty business they don’t want to get involved in, or that the level of an individual citizen’s ability to affect the government dominated by the “same old, same old” attitude of the professional politicians does not reach their standard for requiring their active participation.  The result is highly organized conservative and fundamentalist religious groups can bring voters to the polls and despite smaller numbers, impose their will on the much larger but more apathetic general population. This is to say nothing of the effect of the huge amounts of money from wealthy donors perverting elections at all levels since 2010.

5165997,"Dean7","Comment","","*Supreme Court Rulings on an inadequate health care law:*  The basic legal battle over the Affordable Care Act was whether the federal government had the right to penalize non-participants.  A negative ruling would have undercut the financial heart of the legislation, and almost certainly would have ended this feeble attempt to expand health care coverage for the 48 million Americans estimated to be living without health insurance. The fear was that the five conservative justices would hold the Constitutional right of the federal government to regulate commerce did not apply to this issue, because it was a penalty on inactivity, not economic activity which would be covered by the Constitution.  The five justices did in fact rule that way, but the four liberal judges dissented, mostly based on the idea that health care in the US was a commercial operation worth billions of dollars.  (Anyone who gets a bill from his doctor for $150 for 15 minutes of his time, or a bill from the hospital for five dollars for an ordinary aspirin tablet has to be aware medical care in the US is a highly commercial profit making venture).  Much to everyone’s surprise however, Chief Justice Roberts agreed that the commerce clause did not apply, but that the non-participation feature was actually a tax.  Since taxation is clearly constitutional, Roberts joined the four liberals and wrote the majority opinion approving the ACA.  Exactly why Roberts acted outside of his usual conservativism is something of a mystery.  Some speculated that Roberts had suddenly undergone a spasm of has Catholic conscience, but it is more likely the Chief Justice  did not want to make a decision that would put the Supreme Court in an even more unpopular light. 
 If I were on the court, I would argue that health care of Americans is a national issue which can no longer be relegated to the states. I would ask the question why recruits applying to the armed forces from Mississippi should have higher rejection rates because of poor health – more obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, more mental problems, than recruits from a state like Connecticut.   I would point out the ACA does not meet the standard for providing adequate national health care to the nation and I would throw this unworkable, Rube Goldberg apparatus called ACA back to Congress for rewriting, citing Medicare as a proper model.

These rulings invoke the Fourteenth Amendment which says “No state shall…. deprive any person of the life, liberty and property without the due process of law”.    Included in this process are freedom of speech, press, assembly and religion; the right to bear arms;  protection against unreasonable search and seizure; , protection against self-incrimination and double jeopardy;  right to a trial by jury, to an attorney and to confront witnesses;  and protection against cruel and unusual punishment. Since most crimes are prosecuted in states and local courts, not in federal courts, these protections are fundamental to the rights Americans enjoy today.

Federal grants-in-aid would be a carrot, in that states are not forced to take the grant, but if they do they will receive extra funding.  However, this funding must be used by the states according to the conditions put forth by the federal government.

A ""stick"" approach is when the federal government threatens to pull money from the states if they do not follow certain federal policy.  An example of this is when the federal government required states to set the drinking age at 21 years old.  If states did not comply, they were subject to a reduction in federal highway funds.

The justification for this is that the money is viewed as belonging to the federal government and the federal government is granting this money to the states.  Therefore, the federal government is allowed to set conditions on the money they are giving to the states.","","",NA,"","2015-11-02 05:40:00","2015-11-02 05:40:00","False","","55e5fbf89714b09e52000df6","5636f75b9c2aee216c0009d3",2,0
8656044,"MisterJeff","Comment","","For the taxing clause, the pro argument is that Congress is allowed to tax the people.  All citizens in the United States have to pay a health care tax unless they obtain heath care insurance.  In that case, they are exempt from the tax.

The con argument for the taxing clause is that the Affordable Care Act is imposing a ""penalty"" on those who do not obtain heath insurance.  Because this is a ""penalty"" and not a ""tax"" it is therefore not under Congress's authority.

The Supreme court ruled that not having health insurance results in Congress placing a tax and not a penalty on the American public, and allowed the ACA's mandatory payment for not having health insurance to stand.

With regards to the commerce clause, the pro argument is that Congress is allowed to regulate interstate commerce.  People without health insurance create an extra cost for those with health insurance and therefore interfere with interstate commerce.  

The con argument is that people who do not have health insurance are not engaged in interstate commerce.  Because they are not buying anything, they are not engaged in commerce.

The Supreme court ruled that not having health insurance does not impact interstate commerce and that the ACA is not valid under the commerce clause.

The net result of all this is that the two clauses were flipped from most people's expectations.  The commerce clause has been traditionally used to expand the federal government's influence over the states.  The taxing clause was downplayed by the supporters of the ACA because they didn't want to associate the ACA with the negative connotations of a ""tax"".  However, in the end, the ACA supporters won, although not in the way they were expecting.

I would have ruled in support of the ACA but in the opposite direction on the clauses.  Health insurance is a significant factor in the economy of the United States and these needs cross state lines.  The fine for not having health insurance is an administrative penalty and not a tax.  That is why I would have found the ACA to be constitutional, but with a different way to support it.","","",NA,"","2015-11-02 06:08:00","2015-11-02 06:08:00","False","","55e5fc969714b01c9d000e1f","5636fdc2d2aca5b29c001348",2,0

Actually the election situation seems like, it is still influenced of the history of the U.S., because Barack Obama is the one and only ethnical black coloured president of the U.S. since the beginning of governmental history! The actual candidates for precidency doesn't offer to vote several black candidates in this election - only one - the most candidates still are white men or women, and in the U.S. actually is a conflict in policing because of rough police handling of situations in which black people are involved or reported. I am Sorry, that I am not able to analyze the situation and the influence of the several staten institutions, because I am from Germany in Europe and this is why I am actually not able to read the daily newspapers of the U.S., what is necessary in my opinion to interpret the governmental activities and balances of a nation.","","",NA,"","2015-11-07 01:10:00","2015-11-07 01:10:00","False","","55e5fa8d9714b0069b000e5a","563d4f70d2aca5b04f001650",2,0

Maybe the citizens and peoples of the U.S. still have to recover from the discriminations of some minorities in 1950th, so that the voting rate is less high than in the E.U.!

7089566,"VICTORCAM","Comment","","I THING, have came to the decision that Obamacare is unconstitutional. As the justices agreed, the government cannot force a citizen to engage in economic activity. It only has the power to regulate commerce. Hence, this has created a dangerous precedent for the future.

Other situation is the Sebelius case arose when roughly two dozen states challenged the provision of the 2010 Affordable Care Act that requires individuals to acquire health insurance or pay a penalty when they file their taxes. 

In terms of the commerce clause, the pro argument was that health care is a component of interstate commerce, which is within the power of Congress to regulate. Proponents argued that individuals without health insurance place a burden on interstate commerce. When they get sick, they go to an emergency room for treatment but are unable to pay the bill. That cost then gets passed along to others, raising the cost of their insurance and burdening commerce. Opponents of this argument conceded that Congress has the power to regulate commerce but argued that the individual insurance mandate penalizes people for not engaging in commerce, which is not within Congress’s commerce power. If Congress had that power, they argued, it could compel people to engage in all sorts of activities, forcing them, for example, to eat healthy foods rather than junk foods. In its ruling, the Supreme Court divided 5-4 in favor of the argument that the commerce clause does not empower Congress to force people to engage in a commercial activity.

The Supreme Court also divided 5-4 on whether the taxing clause of the Constitution permits Congress to impose a penalty on those who fail to obtain health insurance. In this case, the Court’s majority sided with Congress, saying that the penalty was effectively a tax on individuals who don’t obtain insurance and, as a tax, is within Congress’s authority. Opponents of this argument pointed out that both President Obama, who pushed for enactment of the health care reform law, and the Democratic majority in Congress that passed it into law, refrained from calling the penalty a “tax.” They repeatedly referred to it as a “penalty.” Reasoning from this fact, opponents of the law said that Congress’s intended the penalty as a penalty and not as a tax, and that it was therefore inaccurate to interpret as a valid act under Congress’s taxing power.

3525442,"GlauciaAlves","Comment","","In the original system for electing federal officials, House members were chosen by popular votes while senators were chosen by the state legislatures and the president was chosen by electors who in turn were chosen by the state legislatures. This initial system was designed by the ""founding fathers"" to address three major problems: the framers were afraid of giving much power to the people; they needed to balance the expectation of both small and large states in a scenario without a national identity

The framers' concerns about how much power the people should have was legitimate because ""in 1787, no republic like the United States existed anywhere in the world"". Therefore everything was new and the framers did not have much information about how much power the people should have without compromising the safety. Besides, some incidents that happened during and after Revolution led them believing that it would be more appropriate restricting the people power.

Moreover, the framers were trying to unite states under a single national government that did not have any national identity and were concerned about their role in this new system: the large states feared sharing their power with small states, while the small ones were concerned not having a properly representation  due their size.

Trying to solve and address these issues, the framers decided to create the House of Representative where the amount of members depended on the size of the states population and the members were chosen by popular vote to satisfy the small states and population, while senators were chosen by state legislatures and the president, by the electors (each state had the same number the electors as members in Congress)  who in turn were chosen by the state legislatures.

But along the years the clamor for popular elections arisen and after some senatorial elections had been stained by scandals and bribery, in 1913 the Seventeenth Amendment was approved and in the following year, there was the first time all senatorial elections were held by popular vote.
Today House members, senators and the electors, responsible to choose the presidente, are chosen by popular vote.

While European countries make easier their voter registration process allowing the log to be done in any official department at the time of issuance of another document, the United States system demands the voter goes to a specific department to register itself.

Arguments that can be made for keeping the NSA program are that terrorist attacks are prevented because of the program. Although not many, every attack has the potential to be as bad as 9/11. It makes sure that we take all precautions necessary to keep our country safe. National security is at stake. Despite drawing huge criticism, the NSA program is not just surveying all Americans at all times. They strategically survey people based on reasonable suspicion. 

Arguments that can be made against the NSA program is that it is unconstitutional. It does prevent some attacks or at least keep the government informed of the whereabouts of foreigners, but it does so without cause or warrant sometimes. There are a couple loopholes that can be used so the government does not have to go through much paperwork. Also, the privacy of a people may be hurt. Because the government can gather information on vague terms, the average citizen has the information that has the potential to be surveyed. Although the government does its best to simply isolate to targeted people, it is inevitable that people will have some information that will be caught in the process. 


A key component of limited government that could potentially help here is simply transparency as to what is being surveilled when and how. To reveal all methods of surveillance is unnecessary as the foreign governments would have access to these secrets but to at least have all three branches balancing out the power within the NSA would be more ideal. However, to get rid of this program is not in America's best interests. Limited government means that the government cannot have power to do everything, but it is allowed to help in national security interests.

No, of course not denying  emergency healthcare to those who can't pay for it. Besides, it is emergency. If you have to check whether the person can pay for it, then you are wasting valuable time. The person migh die in the meantime.
 
And what are you going to do to veriy whether the person can pay for it, e.g., in an accident or during a fire? Search the person belongings to see if he/she can pay or shout into the burning building whether the person can pay?

Nevertheless, in the Ronald Regan government, who believed the scope of national government should be limited, the possibilities were broadened by creating ""block grants"" which allowed states to have ""considerable control over how federal aid was spent"".

This sovereignty shift is allowed by the taxing and spending clause that, as interpreted by Supreme Court rulings, grants Congress ""broad authority to tax and spend for the purpose of promoting “the general welfare’"".","","",NA,"","2015-11-12 20:06:00","2015-11-12 20:06:00","False","","55e5fbf89714b09e52000df6","5644f15c1dfe59735c000189",2,0
3525442,"GlauciaAlves","Comment","","In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012) one the aspects questioned concerning the ACA was the ""individual mandate"", which requires individuals have insurance or pay a penalty. 

The government alleged it was a commerce-related issue since uninsured people imposes ""burden on the economy"", therefore Congress has authority, according ""commerce clause"", to regulate.

While Republican lawyers demonstrated that government, despite accounting for regulate commerce, it does not have authority to ""force individuals to engage in commerce"".
The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Republicans. Nevertheless, Court upheld the ACA under the light of Congress's taxing power since the individual mandate ""may reasonably be characterised as a tax"".

I would have sided with Supreme Court in both clauses because analyzing the commerce clause the ""individual mandate"" seems an absurd and arbitrary. None government should be allowed to oblige citizens engage in commerce or buy anything. 
Nevertheless, analysing the ""tax clause"" we understand that when government levy taxes, in fact, it is obligating us to pay for services - better schools, better roads, better health care.

Maybe, the government could have avoided all this fuss if it just had levied another tax or a worst problem could have been created.

However, as the Bill of Rights, which provides rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of press, and a number of fair trial guarantees, was originally created just to be applied to federal government.

State governments were not bound by the Bill of Rights; therefore, some state laws and approaches were appealed to the Supreme Court that, under the light of the 14th Amendment, has started to rule in favor of individual rights.

As the 14th Amendment prevents states to ""deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law” but does not detail the terms, the Supreme Court has begun to understand that some rights of the Bill of Rights were implicit and should be juridically incorporated as being part of the 14th Amendment. 

This process, known as ""selective incorporation"",  has been crucial to guarantee that states and local governments would ensure the peoples rights.

The lack of faith in the common man`s judgement caused the framers of the constitution to exclude the senate from the popular vote, and the use of the electoral college in presidential elections.

Initially popular vote did not elect senators-- rather, state legislatures appointed senators from their states.  This had two significant consequences.  First, powerful interests in a state could influence the state legislature to choose a candidate.  Secondly, it prevented deeply partisan legistlatures from selecting senators and leaving vacant seats in the senate.  The framers of the constitution desired a degree of separation from between the people and the senator because they thought common people would be too self-absorbed in local issues or unable to exercise proper judgement on a federal level.

The electoral college also created a degree of separation between the people and the selection of the president.  Instead electors-- one for every representitive in the HOR and one for each senator-- from each state cast a vote for the president.  State legislatures and later popular vote selected electors.  

A parliamentary system permits sweeping changes in government whereas the United States' system allows for gradual changes to occur.  When voters are allowed to vote in many smaller elections it allows them to send signals to the ruling parties about how they feel about the current governance.  For instance, if the citizenry doesn't like what a republican controlled congress is doing they can elect more democrats, despite not necessarily taking away a republican majority.  By contrast, with a parliamentary system, the citizenry can cause a sweeping change, but have little power to influence lawmakers until the next election is held.  In other words, a parliamentary system allows its constituency to exact large, punctuated changes, whereas the US system allows feedback and incremental changes which may or may not influence government.  How responsive congress or the presidency is to this will determine how powerful the people's voice is.","","",NA,"","2015-11-19 01:45:00","2015-11-19 01:45:00","False","","55e5fa6201772bc852000dac","564d29ce9da26a3fa1000034",2,0

Even after that restriction was eliminated, the minorities didn't have chance for chosing the officials. Now there are many thing to ensure most of the citizens exercise their right to vote; however the limits are banishing and people can vote directly for representant and senators (who before were chosen by state legislatures) and indirectly for the president.
I think both sistems -presidential and parliamentary- give to the voters the same influence over the lawmakers, because it doesn't depend on the system itself such influence works, but on the will of voters, candidates and legislators. It also depends on the specific rules for that relationship (which can make it closer or not) and the political education of the people.","","",NA,"","2015-11-19 01:56:00","2015-11-19 01:56:00","False","","55e5fa6201772bc852000dac","564d2c529da26a3a43000023",2,0

For instance, the federal government placed conditions on federal highway funding to increase the drinking age to 21.  By offering grants or offering its own resources in lieu of states' ones-- in turn, saving the states money-- the federal government has encroached on powers that were traditionally or perhaps originally intended to be reserved for the states.  The judicial branch has permitted this because frequently issues fall under the necessary and proper clause or the commerce clause.

3446790,"tbarron","Comment","","I believe the court reached the correct decision.

First, the legitimacy of the taxing provision for the individual mandate component seems dubious to me.  However, I think the justices who ignored this realized that congress could pass another act that circumvented this problem, but knew that the effect would be essentially the same.  So rather than waste more time and money it was acceptable.  As a society we cannot come to terms with letting people die in waiting rooms.  However, at the same time it is unfair for some to shoulder the burden of those who choose to buy a smartphone instead of health insurance. 

Secondly, I believe that the applicability of commerce clause is also ambiguous in this case.  Many hospitals are interconnected, often times regional or national, and therefore the burden of a patient without health insurance in Nevada for example produces a burden on another hospital in its network in Arizona.  However, large companies in my experience are run with their own little market systems and thus the effect is more subdued than the federal government asserts.

7089566,"VICTORCAM","Comment","","The true is,  the selective incorporation is the process whereby the Supreme Court, through use of the 14th Amendment, has protected most of the rights in the Bill of Rights from action by state and local governments. When it was enacted, the Bill of Rights applied only to action by the federal government. Thus, for example, Congress was prohibited by the First Amendment for infringing on free speech but state and local governments were not. Today, they are prohibited from doing so, and the reason is selective incorporation through the 14th Amendment.

Ratified in the aftermath of the Civil War, the 14th Amendment prohibits state governments (and local governments, which are agents of the states) from denying their residents “due process” of law. The 14th Amendment does not specify what is covered by “due process.” Starting in 1925, the Supreme Court in a series of rulings made that determination, holding that a range of individual rights contained in the Bill of Rights are protected from action by state and local governments. 

This process, whereby specific rights contained in the Bill of Rights are extended to the state and local governments, is called selective incorporation. It is selective because only particular rights in the Bill of Rights are given protection. And it’s called incorporation because the process involves incorporating (or bringing) into the 14th Amendment some of the rights contained in the Bill of Rights, thus protecting them from state or local action.

The Gideon case, which was discussed in the lecture, provides an example. In that case, the 6th Amendment right to an attorney—which applies in federal court cases—was incorporated into the 14th Amendment, thereby extending the right to an attorney to cases heard in state and local courts.

Selective incorporation has been extraordinarily important in securing Americans’ rights. In the U.S. system, state and local governments have primary responsibility for law enforcement and public safety, which are the activities where authorities are most likely to intrude on individuals’ rights. Because of selective incorporation, state and local officials are obligated to respect their residents’ constitutional rights.","","",NA,"","2015-11-23 06:08:00","2015-11-23 06:08:00","False","","55e5fd599714b0069b000e5f","5652ad519da26a21eb00023b",2,0

As far as Parliamentary v. our system of staggered voting, I'm not certain whether I'm pro or against the Parliamentary system.  First off the Parliamentary system is when the entire political votes are done together for the entire branch of government where the staggered system that we have is done in increments of 2,4,& 6 years with the idea of having checks & balances of each party.  But, it seems that nothing gets done and there is constant gridlock and the people who elect this individuals into office are the ones that lose out.  It might be an interesting idea to have an entire body of elected officials from one party (Republican or Democrat) and allow their policies to be put in place for the period of their term in office.  There would be excuses for success or failure and if their ideas suck, they will be removed from office and the opposing party would have a chance to show their ideas.

The same could be said for laws governing searches of property. A [meta]database of information related to communications that might give leads on the likelihood of a terror attack could surely not have been envisioned by the Framers of the constitution when they wrote the 4th Amendment:

1879142,"mschofie","Comment","","Contrast the original system for electing federal officials with the system of today, noting in each case whether voters have acquired a more direct voice in the election process than was originally the case. 

The constitution specified that only members of the House of representatives would be selected by the voters in a ""direct"" election. Senators were to be selected by the state legislature and the President would be selected by members of the electoral college who were, in turn, selected by the individual state legislatures in direct proportion to the number of House members from each state.  Moreover, the nomination process was controlled by state legislatures and there weren't primaries.  The terms of each elected body (2 years, House; 6 years, Senate; 4 years, President) was designed to insure a slow course correction / public policy changes by the government. The theory behind the indirect election of Senators and the President was to avoid the tyrrany of the majority whereby a polarized electorate would lead to drastic changes.

The biggest change was the direct election of Senators and, later, the establishment of a primary process for Senators.  On one hand, this increased the direct influence of the electorate but, on the other hand, it diminished corruption at the state level where senators were selected by their willingness to do the bidding of those legislators.

In general, the US system leads to smaller ""course corrections"" than a parliamentary procedure where the composition of the government could change more drastically. In parliament, the prime minister is chosen by the party with the most votes and not (I think think this is right) by a direct election of the people.","","",NA,"","2015-12-10 19:16:00","2015-12-10 19:16:00","False","","55e5fab49714b0b433000de8","5669cf9008f9a59c2e00012f",2,0

The process started with FDR (1930s) and The New Deal when programs were created  to alleviate  suffering and help the health and welfare of the citizenry form the Great Depression. LBJ (1960s)  and his Great Society announced the War on Poverty and furthered federal grants in aid..  Both eras expanded federal authority, which was enabled by large Democratic majorities in Congress - FDR's and LBJ's political party.  The Supreme Court began to support these programs.....the New Deal used the Commerce clause for a set of economic regulations and relief programs created to fight the societal challenges (25% unemployment, and half of the employed were temp ee's).  LBJ used federal grants to help start programs to alleviate the suffering of the truly needy.  Federal grants in aid have become very important; they act as inducements for states to carry out particular programs with federal dollars that are tied to specific programs or categories of spending.  The justification for Congress to determine how states can use federal grants in aid is that they have specific stipulations tied to the money and the program. The states must follow the guidelines of face being cut off from the aid.  These requirements can be enforced legally.

149302,"317Machine","Comment","","The framers of the Constitution realized that in a strong federal government, even elected officials could consolidate power if left unchecked, and they feared a tyranny of the majority as much as they feared a single tyrant. Therefore, they separated the powers of government and provided they be elected or appointed in different ways. The people would directly elect members of the House of Representatives, popularly elected electors would pick the president, state governments (themselves elected)  would appoint senators, and Supreme Court justices would be nominated and confirmed by the president and Senate, respectively. Ideally, this would prevent 51% of the people from dominating the other 49%, and in practice, it worked fairly well. Political parties quickly worked the Electoral College to their advantage with the Twelfth Amendment, removing most of that barrier between the voters and the government. Then, the Seventeenth Amendment made all senators popularly elected. Today, the voting public has much more power than the framers envisioned.

Also, the US elects a president every four years, while the legislative branch shakes up every two years- congressmen and at least a third of the Senate face reelection every two years. In practice, this contributes heavily to divided government. Over the last 100 years, only twice has a president gained seats in both houses of Congress- FDR in 1934 during the Great Depression, and GWB in 2002 following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Since wave elections are usually immediately followed by counter-waves, it is very hard to change the status quo, even with a landslide election. Also, this means that during a presidential election, 2/3 of the Senate is safe, so it usually takes more than one wave election to fully tip the balance of power. Contrast this with a parliamentary system where one party or coalition wins an election decisively and then has carte blanche to do whatever it wants.

149302,"317Machine","Comment","","In NFIB v. Sibelius, the government made the case that imposing the individual mandate was legal, justified by the interstate commerce clause and the taxing and spending clause. First, uninsured people impose a cost on the health care system due to the fact that they can demand health care from emergency providers. Since such firms and governments must allow for the cost of uncompensated care of uninsured people, such people are participating in the health care market whether they demand service or not. Also, very rarely will an American go through life never needing any kind of health care, so in aggregate, there is no such thing as a person who does not participate in the market. Also, the individual ""mandate"" was crafted not as a requirement with civil penalties, but a new tax that would be credited off with the purchase of a qualifying insurance policy. However the politicians presented it during debate and passage, it had the form of a tax increase.

Opponents of the bill argued that the government could not regulate activity that was not happening- that it could not compel people to buy a product that they would not otherwise. Also, they argued that the money an uninsured individual would owe, however it was imposed and collected, was coercive enough that it was not truly a tax, but a penalty outside the bounds of Congress' taxing authority.

Ultimately, the Supreme Court decided 5-4 that the individual mandate was outside the constitutional bounds of Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce. This was a very significant hard limit on Congress' power, as the Court had historically upheld many policies and programs that relied on this authority (banning illicit drugs, for example). However, Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the liberal wing of the Court in upholding the mandate on the basis of Congress' taxing authority. The 5-4 majority ruled that much in the same way that Congress refunds taxes for mortgage interest, college tuition, or childcare, Congress can impose a new tax, then credit those who purchase insurance or meet any of a number of other requirements. 

If I were on the Court deciding the case, I would rule that an uninsured individual does not exist outside the health care market and that the risks and costs associated with the tens of millions of uninsured Americans is a significant enough piece of the market to warrant regulation.  Furthermore, the structure of the penalty for being uninsured was clearly within the bounds of Congress' taxing authority. Congress is not compelling me to take out a mortgage because it offers a tax credit for such a purchase- rather, it is giving me an incentive to make that purchase using it's power to tax and spend. I think that the Court (i.e. Roberts himself) made a decision that would set a limit on the Congress' power under the interstate commerce clause while still preserving Obamacare- if not for its merit, but for continuity and certainty in the marketplace. It was a results-based decision, but one reasonably well-justified.","","",NA,"","2015-12-20 18:50:00","2015-12-20 18:50:00","False","","55e5fc969714b01c9d000e1f","5676f86708ea03641f000201",2,0

Citizens also have a more direct voice in the election of the president. Even though the Electoral College system is still an obstacle to direct vote, the fact that the votes of the great electors correspond to those of the majority of the state's citizens helps. But this system which make a state vote as a whole can lead to situations in which a candidate who has received less votes is elected due to the way the votes are spread out in the different states.
Seperate elections for House, senators, and the president allow that a party will be sanctionned in one of the institutions if it is not performing well in one of the others. Even though it may seem less direct, it gives the voters more power to keep the parties in check than if they elect at once all their representatives : the resulting parliament will reflect the health of a party at a precise moment, and there will be no way to keep it in check until a next election. This may be seen as a way of being efficient, and not permanently campaigning, for onesself or for others in ones party, which is a critic often heard in the American system.

1849909,"corgifan","Comment","","Example: US Senators were elected by state legislatures rather than a direct vote of the citizens (eligible voters) in a state. Today US Senators are directly voted by the people—not by representatives in state legislatures. In this case, voters have acquired a more direct voice than they formerly had. Example: Before primary elections were held, nominating conventions—and thus the delegates to the conventions (and power brokers)--had more say in who received the presidential nomination. Today, the outcomes of state primaries (direct vote by eligible voters) determine who the state convention delegates will support as a presidential nominee. Therefore, I would say votes have acquired a more direct voice in the election process than was originally the case.

The US system provides voters with greater influence over lawmakers. Congress is highly sensitive to the will of the voters. Representatives are up for election every two years in their district (more like a reaffirmation in many cases). Senatorial elections are held every six years. Presidents get elected every four years. Combining staggered voting schedules, direct vote, and the check and balance system, votes have greater influence over lawmakers. If we the people do not like a representative (for whatever reason) we can vote him/her out of office. Congressional gridlock due to partisanship politics is more reflection of values and interests than it is a flaw in our system. The partisanship divide is not a flaw of the system. To a large extent, it is the outcome of values. 
“Winner takes all” perhaps better reflects the parliamentary system. Thinking about Western European countries with parliamentary systems, there may be more parties for voters to choose among but this is offset by the “winner take all” outcomes. Once a party is elected, they exercise legislative and executive control—and the more they succeed in building a coalition of parties agreeing to join together to create a majority, the fewer the oppositional forces. The out-of-power party (parties) functions in an oppositional role—offering different ideas and trying to persuade voters to stand with them in next election. This keeps gridlock at a minimum because the party in power gets to legislate without many hurdles.

1849909,"corgifan","Comment","","There are several possible reasons why voting rates in the US are lower than in Europe. For example, in the US voting is a two-step process in almost every state: first, voter registration and second, voting. Also, the lack of voter registration and voting on the same day may negatively impact US voting rates. Voting on Sunday, election days as national holidays also may positively impact voter turnout in Europe versus our workweek/workday/school day first Tuesday in November voting scheduling. In the US, voting rates may be lower for a myriad of possible reasons: absence of trust in government; the degree of partisanship among the population; lack of general interest in politics; institutional barriers to voting; convenience; and, a failure of faith in the true effect of voting (Friedman, H.S., 2012. The Measure of a Nation: How to Regain America's Competitive Edge and Boost Our Global Standing). I would add one other reason—a need for American citizens to learn (or relearn) what we used to call civics. I hypothesize that lack of knowledge/lack of education about American Government is a reason why people do not use every opportunity to cast their precious and hard won vote. 

Disadvantaged groups such as blacks in the southern states faced roadblocks to voting by all sorts of terrible practices (poll taxes; tests; threats; harassment). Lower numbers of poorer/less economically advantaged people tend vote in the U.S. Younger people are voting in lower numbers than in the past. Requirements for voter identification impact people who are eligible but simply do not have an ID to show. Not allowing voter registration on election day is another deterrent to voting for people. Voting on one day—a weekday—works against people getting to the polls. ","","",NA,"","2016-01-02 17:22:00","2016-01-02 17:22:00","False","","55e5fb8701772be57d000de0","568807687febe56bc8000610",2,0

States/localities were not forced take the money (federal cash payments) for funding programs such as Medicaid. The federal government, in turn, requires that the money be used for the purpose for which it was given (e.g., health care for low income people) and cannot be applied to other purposes. This type of assistance expands the powers of the federal government into states/localities by requiring adherence to rules and procedures it established for eligibility and continued support.

Women could not vote. Moreover the electoral college actually voted for the President. The state legislatures voted for Senators. Only the House of Representatives was actually voted on by ordinary citizens who were granted that right. Now slavery is abolished, all citizens of any race or ethnic background can vote. You need not have property to vote. Women CAN vote. Also, the people vote for candidates to registered parties in primaries. This is done for both Representatives and Senators. Both are also voted for directly by the people. The electoral college is bound to the will of the people in the state that they represent. There is currently a much more direct democracy than previously imagined by the founders. Staggering the vote as is done in the US leads to Congress members who are bound more to the votes in their area and not as closely bound to the party as a whole as it represents the nation. Also, having individual offices voted on allows for a combination of different parties to be elected and then reshuffled at various times instead of all at once. In contrast, other nations elect their entire legislature at once and then the party governs for some period of time before having to campaign again. The disadvantage to the American system is that the candidates must forever campaign and find it difficult to pass legislation that might not initially seem appealing but may be necessary. On the other hand, the legislative system of all at once voting for the government used by some other nations can lead to overanxious/passionate voters voting for a government that might seem appealing at that moment, but if things are not getting done that should be done or if new information comes to light showing that some of the policies promoted may not be necessary voters are left with little recourse but to wait out a terrible government with little way of influencing policy.

91273,"MisterB","Comment","","American voting rates are lower because the United States does not provide uniform times for voting across the nation, does not provide uniform methods of identification and registration for voters that are guaranteed by the government and certainly not paid for fully by said government. The confusion caused by having different elections in various years makes it difficult for many people to know when voting is happening. This is especially true of local elections. Moreover, lack of holidays existing on voting days can make it difficult for people to vote on days they work. Lack of uniform standards on absentee voting and the difficulties of registering to do so can also be a hindrance for those with little income and a need to work in insecure jobs, that might fire someone for being late for example. Also, by not providing voter ID to all voters it is time consuming and costly to get said voter ID. Some states have even gone so far as to close down stations that previously could provide such IDs making it all the more difficult for people in poor counties with little money to access them. All these things serve to disenfranchise Americans from the vote. Europeans have systems in place to ensure nearly everyone has an ID. Also, most nations hold elections at more regular times with single high-stakes elections often and with holidays to vote in a number of case. These serve to ease the burden of making time and proving one's identity to be able to vote. Of course, minorities whose families are either immigrants or who come from families that suffered from systematic oppression often do not have the same kind of savings and opportunities built up over generations that other Americans might have because their families could not possibly earn enough to have any savings to provide an education or pass down wealth that would help current generations have the means to afford the IDs. This puts minorities at a disadvantage making them a higher proportion of those who can not vote. Also, younger people, even those from a more advantaged background, still are at a lesser income level until they establish themselves and do not have the money, and often do not have the time with school and insecure jobs to go out and vote let alone secure an ID or absentee ballot. Elderly people are similarly at low incomes often as they can no longer work and are on fixed incomes. This combined with health problems and a frequent lack of digital literacy can lead to difficulties in securing IDs, getting absentee votes prepared and getting out to vote at voting booths.

Examples include educations grants requiring access for and lack of discrimination toward people with handicaps, uniform legal alcohol consumption age of 21 across the nation, among other areas. The passage of such bills and the requirements made by Congress to receive these benefits is justified by the fact that the United States is an integrated nation now, that is people's actions in one area have a direct effect on other parts of the country, furthermore, people move from place to place all over the country now at a rate unheard of in the early days of the US. On top of this, we have more information about the need for certain minimum standards with the increased scientific and statistical knowledge we have of various issues. This makes it clear that certain standards are necessary as universal standards. Thus, it is largely justified that the Congress would seek to create some uniformity of minimums across the nation. One advantage to this method and not simply passing a federal law, it could be argued, is that each state has its own culture and traditions, its own laws, and its own natural environment. All these things can play a role in affecting what laws would make sense in terms of their particular implementation. By creating standards without writing the particular rules, these considerations and caveats can be taken into account while simultaneously ensuring that basic standards are maintained across the nation, just with slight variations in style of implementation.

91273,"MisterB","Comment","","The pro arguments in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012) regarding the commerce clause involved the idea that Americans who did not have insurance would place an undue burden on all Americans by raising the cost for others. The con argument stated that the US government should not have the ability to require people to engage in commerce if they did not want to. The justices ruled against the justification based on the commerce clause. I would have to agree that if the ruling could only be construed as the government universally has the ability to require people to engage in highly specified activities when they engage in certain areas of commerce were they to rule in favor, that this would be a terrible decision. The other argument was that the penalty imposed could be construed as a tax. I believe this concept was only offered briefly at the end with little argument against it offered by the opposing side. The argument against this would be that it is called a penalty not a tax, and that the government should not be able to penalize people for not engaging in commerce anymore that they should be able to require them to do so. This is a good argument but I think there is reasonable justification in the idea of the penalty essentially being a form of tax. This only is true because people are only require to pay this, if they do not get a certain minimum of insurance otherwise, in which case this fee would be waived, and because people at lower income levels are given subsidies to get insurance and avoid fees or are on medicaid. Unfortunately, the lack of medicaid expansion has left some people uncovered in many states, however, because of the combination of incentives, taxes, an waivers at various levels, this does appear to be very similar to the tax code in place for income in the United States, complexities and all. I think the ruling is overall justified. Still, one has to wonder what the restraints are on this kind of tax coercion. Could taxes be employed if certain minimum numbers of healthy foods are not eaten, similar to the argument made against the commerce clause justification? In all likelihood, were something like this tried the court would rule against it and narrow the areas where the tax clause can be applied. Nonetheless, it might have been simpler if the Congress simply set up minimum insurance standards, WITH a federal system of health coverage for those who can not afford coverage otherwise or prefer it, and a fee if someone does not get either one. That would have simply given people a requirement of coverage universally through the government, with a tax penalty for not doing so, with the alternative option of using private insurance, with that insurance having to meet the at least the same standards. This might have avoided having to rule in somewhat of a gray area, that while justified, could still waste court time later when the ruling must clarified if applied to another less justified area that is commerce/tax related.","","",NA,"","2016-01-05 12:08:00","2016-01-05 12:08:00","False","","55e5fc969714b01c9d000e1f","568bb25408ea03fae40007c3",2,0
7901980,"edithhinds","Comment","","Justice Roberts held that the financial penalty in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) amounted to a tax and that since it was not a direct tax (only applied to those that did not take out health insurance) it did not have to be shared between the states. Justice Roberts also believed that Congress could only regulate interstate commercial activity not inactivity.  But it was held that the tax could be seen as additional tax on those who earn a certain amount but choose not to take out health insurance.  Justice Ginsberg saw it differently - that those who did not take out health insurance affected interstate commerce by increasing costs to others and therefore were legitimately penalised.  Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Alito believed that by choosing to see a penalty as a tax, the court was rewriting a law that could only legitimately be decided by Congress.  If Congress had wanted the penalty to be seen as a tax, they would have used the word tax.  In my opinion, the Commerce Clause, as a general, undefined clause could easily encompass the individual manadate as held by Ginsberg.  Furthermore, strict constructionists such as Scalia and Thomas are wrong to look only at the text and not to consider the intent of the law.  A law should not be struck down on a narrow basis, but if it is reasonable to find a way to render it constitutional, it should be done so.","","",NA,"","2016-01-05 19:23:00","2016-01-05 19:23:00","False","","55e5fc969714b01c9d000e1f","568c1816a667780544000026",2,0

The role it has played in the expansion of federal authority is that: it helped change the relationship between the federal and state governments. Part of power used by local governments has been shifted toward the federal government.

Congress has authority to determine how states and localities can use federal grants-in-aid. This is based on Article 1 with the commerce  clause that  grants to Congress the power to regulate commerce (Section 8) among the states, and the taxing and spending clause, that grants Congress the authority to tax and spend (Section 2).","","",NA,"","2016-01-06 20:04:00","2016-01-06 20:04:00","False","","55e5fc1a01772b01c2000e19","568d73395fd70904f00000cc",2,0

7901980,"edithhinds","Comment","","The original Constitution adopted by the Framers only made provision for popular vote in respect of the House of Representatives.  This has changed over time as follows:  The President, while still elected by the Electoral College, has the delegates to the Electoral College bound by the result of the votes cast in the State concerned.  This is not directly proportional and so the will of the electorate can be thwarted, as in the election of 2000.  The Senate was originally appointed by the State Legislature but are now elected by popular vote.  Thus voters have a more direct say.  The idea behind staggered elections is to prevent majorities forming easily.  Thus the House of Representatives works on a 2-year cycle, the Presidency on a 4-year cycle and the Senate on a 6-year cycle.  This is an attempt to limit the ability of majorities to form that may imperil the freedoms of the citizens.  In a parliamentary system, members of a House are usually elected at the same time and the leader of the majority party forms the executive.  Thus the system is designed to ensure that there is a majority who are able to run the country.  This is the theory in the United Kingdom but the use of Proportional Representation in some countries does try to achieve the same result as the US system.","","",NA,"","2016-01-06 21:14:00","2016-01-06 21:14:00","False","","55e5fa6201772bc852000dac","568d83d35fd709052e0000ea",2,0
